9781604865875,9781604867053,23_Shades_of_black_9781604867053.pdf,23 Shades of Black,,Author,Kenneth Wishnia,Introduction by,Barbara D’Amato,,,,,,,,,,,17.95,"<p><em>23 Shades of Black</em> is socially conscious crime fiction. It takes place in New York City in the early 1980s, i.e., the Reagan years, and was written partly in response to the reactionary discourse of the time, when the current thirty-year assault on the rights of working people began in earnest, and the divide between rich and poor deepened with the blessing of the political and corporate elites. But it is not a political tract, it&rsquo;s a kick-ass novel that was nominated for the Edgar and the Anthony Awards, and made <em>Booklist&rsquo;s</em> Best First Mysteries of the Year.</p>
<p>The heroine, Filomena Buscarsela, is an immigrant who experienced tremendous poverty and injustice in her native Ecuador, and who grew up determined to devote her life to helping others. She tells us that she really should have been a priest, but since that avenue was closed to her, she chose to become a cop instead. The problem is that as one of the first Latinas on the NYPD, she is not just a woman in a man&rsquo;s world, she is a woman of color in a white man&rsquo;s world. And it&rsquo;s hell. Filomena is mistreated and betrayed by her fellow officers, which leads her to pursue a case independently in the hopes of being promoted to detective for the Rape Crisis Unit. </p><p>Along the way, she is required to enforce unjust drug laws that she disagrees with, and to betray her own community (which ostracizes her as a result) in an undercover operation to round up undocumented immigrants. Several scenes are set in the East Village art and punk rock scene of the time, and the murder case eventually turns into an investigation of corporate environmental crime from a working class perspective that is all-too-rare in the genre.</p><p>And yet this thing is damn funny, too.</p>"

A more critical history might present it as a genocide in which Indigenous peoples were helpless victims, overwhelmed and awed by European military power. In reality, neither of these views is correct. </p>
<p><em>500 Years of Indigenous Resistance</em> is more than a history of European colonization of the Americas. In this slim volume, Gord Hill chronicles the resistance by Indigenous peoples, which limited and shaped the forms and extent of colonialism. This history encompasses North and South America, the development of nation-states, and the resurgence of Indigenous resistance in the post-WW2 era. </p>"

Coming after<em> Fathering Words: The Making of an African American Writer</em> (published in 2000), this book finds Miller returning to baseball, the game of his youth, in order to find the metaphor that will provide the measurement of his life. At 60, he ponders whether his life can now be entered into the official record books as a success or failure.</p>
<p><em>The 5th Inning</em> is one man&rsquo;s examination of personal relationships, depression, love and loss. This is a story of the individual alone on the pitching mound or in the batters box. It&rsquo;s a box score filled with remembrance. It&rsquo;s a combination of baseball and the blues. The paperback has an additional chapter.</p>"

Crafted in deliberately simple prose and without constant reference to other writers or past events, it can be understood without difficulty and without any prior knowledge of political ideology.</p>
<p>As one of the finest short introductions to the basic concepts, theories, and applications of anarchism, <em>About Anarchism</em> has been translated into many languages, including French, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Polish, and Russian. This new edition includes an updated introduction from Natasha Walter and an expanded biographical sketch of the author, Nicolas Walter, who was a respected writer, journalist, and an active protester against the powers of both the church and the state.</p>"

Although it is not well publicized, the long tradition of refusing to fight in unjust wars continues today within the American military.</p>
<p>In this book, resisters describe in their own words the process they went through, from raw recruits to brave refusers. They speak about the brutality and appalling violence of war; the constant dehumanizing of the enemy&mdash;and of our own soldiers&mdash;that begins in Basic Training; the demands that they ignore their own consciences and simply follow orders. They describe how their ideas about the justification for the current wars changed and how they came to oppose the policies and practices of the U.S. empire, and even war itself. Some of the refusers in this book served one or more tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, and returned with serious problems resulting from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Others heard such disturbing stories of violence from returning vets that they vowed not to go themselves. Still others were mistreated in one way or another and decided they&rsquo;d had enough. Every one of them had the courage to say a resounding &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; The stories in this book provide an intimate, honest look at the personal transformation of each of these young people and at the same time constitute a powerful argument against militarization and endless war. </p>
<p>Also featured are exclusive interviews with Noam Chomsky and Daniel Ellsberg. Chomsky looks at the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the potential of GI resistance to play a role in bringing the troops home. Ellsberg relates his own act of resistance in leaking the <em>Pentagon Papers</em> in 1971 to the current WikiLeaks revelations of U.S. military secrets.</p>"

The first, characteristic of the 1960s Movement in the United States, is &ldquo;organizing.&rdquo; The second, articulated by Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, is &ldquo;accompaniment.&rdquo; The critical difference is that in accompanying one another the promoter of social change and his or her oppressed colleague view themselves as two experts, each bringing indispensable experience to a shared project. Together, as equals, they seek to create what the Zapatistas call &ldquo;another world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Staughton Lynd applies the distinction between organizing and accompaniment to five social movements in which he has taken part: the labor and civil rights movements, the antiwar movement, prisoner insurgencies, and the movement sparked by Occupy Wall Street. His wife Alice Lynd, a partner in these efforts, contributes her experience as a draft counselor and advocate for prisoners in maximum-security confinement.</p>"

Sound far-fetched? It may not be. The past half century is littered with the remains of such experiments in what Raymond calls “libertarian exit.” Often dismissed as little more than the dreams of crazy, rich Caucasians, exit strategies have been tried out from the southwest Pacific to the Caribbean, from the North Sea to the high seas, often with dire consequences for local inhabitants.&nbsp; Based on research in archives in the US, the UK, and Vanuatu, as well as in FBI files acquired through the Freedom of Information Act, Craib explores in careful detail the ideology and practice of libertarian exit and its place in the histories of contemporary cap­italism, decolonization, empire, and oceans and islands. <i>Adventure Capitalism </i>is a global history that intersects with an array of figures: Fidel Castro and the Koch brothers, American segregationists and Melanesian socialists, Honolulu-based real estate speculators and British Special Branch spies, soldiers of fortune and English lords, Orange County engineers and Tongan navigators, CIA operatives and CBS news executives, and a new breed of techno-utopians and an old guard of Honduran coup leaders. This is not only a history of our time but, given the new iterations of privatized exit—seasteads, free private cities, and space colonization—it is also a history of our future.</p>"

It diagnoses the problem and offers practical tips for a DIY remedy. Faced with an ad-saturated world, activists are fighting back, equipped with stencils, printers, high-visibility vests, and utility tools. Their aim is to subvert the adverts that control us.</p>
<p>With case studies from both sides of the Atlantic, this book showcases the ways in which small groups of activists are taking on corporations and states at their own game: propaganda. This international edition includes an illustrated introduction from Josh MacPhee, case studies and interviews with Art in Ad Places, Public Ad Campaign, Resistance Is Female, Brandalism, and Special Patrol Group, plus photography from Luna Park and Jordan Seiler.</p>
<p>This is a call-to-arts for a generation raised on adverts. Beginning with a rich and detailed analysis of the pernicious hold advertising has on our lives, the book then moves on to offer practical solutions and guidance on how to subvert the ads. Using a combination of ethnographic research and theoretical analysis, <em>Advertising Shits in Your Head</em> investigates the claims made by subvertising practitioners and shows how they impact their practice.</p>"

The book is a passionate and erudite charge against the celebrities of the current architectural world, the &ldquo;archistars.&rdquo; According to Franco La Cecla, architecture has lost its way and its true function, as the archistars use the cityscape to build their brand, putting their stamp on the built environment with no regard for the public good.</p>
<p>More than a diatribe against the trade for which he trained, Franco La Cecla issues a call to rethink urban space, to take our cities back from what he calls Casino Capitalism, which has left a string of failed urban projects, from the Sagrera of Barcelona to the expansion of Columbia University in New York City. He finds hope and some surprising answers in the 2006 uprisings in the Parisian suburbs and in wandering the streets of San Francisco. La Cecla recounts his peregrinations, whether as a consultant to urban planners or as an incorrigible flaneur, all the while giving insights into how we might find a way to resist the tyranny of the planners and find the spirit of place. As he comments throughout on the works of past and present masters of urban and landscape writing, including Robert Byron, Mike Davis, and Rebecca Solnit, Franco La Cecla has given us a book that will take an important place in our public discourse.</p>"

Urban planning and development has become increasingly inadequate in response to the daily realities of life in our cities. Human, economic, ethnic, and environmental factors are systematically overlooked in city planning and housing development, and anachronistic, sterile, and formalistic architecture almost invariably prevails. Meanwhile, our cities grow out of internal impulses, not only in slums and favelas but through the pressing needs for public spaces which have sprung forth in great events and movements such as Istanbul&rsquo;s Gezi Park and Occupy Wall Street. Never more than today has democracy played itself out in public spaces, sidewalks, and streets. Urban planners and developers, however, are still prisoners of an obsolete vision of passivity which betrays actual city needs and demands. A new urban science is required which can, first of all, guarantee a civil, dignified life for all&mdash;urban development which ensures the right to a humane mode of daily living, which has been and still is completely ignored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accustomed as we are to thinking that changes take place online or on a global scale, we sense that they are not made of human bodies in urban spaces and that the mere presence in the square of people claiming their right to the city is a political fact, explosive in nature.&rdquo; &mdash;Franco La Cecla (from <em>Against Urbanism</em>)</p>"

More than thirty people were killed and more than one hundred were wounded. This locale is the historic center of Baghdad bookselling, a winding street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. Named after the famed 10th century classical Arab poet al-Mutanabbi, it has been the heart and soul of the Baghdad literary and intellectual community. This anthology begins with a historical introduction to al-Mutanabbi Street and includes the writing of Iraqis as well as a wide swath of international poets and writers who were outraged by this attack.</p>
<p>This book seeks to show where al-Mutanabbi Street starts in all of us: personally, in our communities, and in our nations. It seeks to show the commonality between this small street in Baghdad and our own cultural centers, and why this attack was an attack on us all. This anthology sees al-Mutanabbi Street as a place for the free exchange of ideas; a place that has long offered its sanctuary to the complete spectrum of Iraqi voices. This is where the roots of democracy (in the best sense of that word) took hold many hundreds of years ago. This anthology looks toward al-Mutanabbi Street as an affirmation of all that we hope for in a more just society.</p>

While the Social Democrats grabbed power, radicals across the country rallied to establish a communist society under the slogan &ldquo;All Power to the Councils!&rdquo; The Spartacus League launched an uprising in Berlin, council republics were proclaimed in Bremen and Bavaria, and workers' revolts shook numerous German towns. Yet in an act that would tragically shape the course of history, the Social Democratic government crushed the rebellions with the help of right-wing militias, paving the way for the ill-fated Weimar Republic&mdash;and ultimately the ascension of the Nazis.</p>

Primarily drawing on the work of the nineteenth century anarchist theorists such as Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Proudhon, the book also covers twentieth century anarchist thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, Paul Goodman, Daniel Guerin, and Colin Ward.</p>
<p>This original work will interest philosophers of education and educationalist thinkers as well as those with a general interest in anarchism.</p>"

Born a prince in Tsarist Russia and sent to Siberia to learn his militaristic, aristocratic trade, he instead renounced his titles and took up the &ldquo;beautiful idea&rdquo; of anarchism. Across a continent he would become known as a passionate advocate of a world without borders, without kings and bosses.</p>
<p>From a Russian cell to France, to London and Brighton, he used his extraordinary mind to dissect the birth of State power and then present a different vision, one in which the human impulse to liberty can be found throughout history, undying even in times of defeat. In the three essays presented here, Kropotkin attempted to distill his many insights into brief but brilliant essays on the state, anarchism, and the ideology for which he became a founding name&mdash;anarchist communism.</p>
<p>With a detailed and rich introduction from Brian Morris, and accompanied by bibliographic notes from Iain McKay, this collection contextualises and contemporises three of Kropotkin&rsquo;s most influential essays.</p>"

The anti-police insurgences that followed addressed deep problems of the Swedish welfare state, and the official responses revealed glitches built into democracy itself.</p> <p>In this updated edition of <em>Anarchist Critique of Radical Democracy: The Impossible Argument</em>, sociologist and historian Markus Lundström explores the boundaries of Swedish democracy. He probes in-depth interviews with community residents to explain how the 2013 riots intensified a profound democratic conflict: the social divide between the governors and the governed. Resistance to this divide is then traced through the defiance of governance and approaches to democracy in the history of anarchist thought.</p> <p>This book offers an original introduction to anarchism. It relates the diversity of anarchist thought to anti-police riots and the radicalization of democracy.</p>"

Kirwin Shaffer shows that anarchists played a significant&mdash;until now little-known&mdash;role among Cuban leftists in shaping issues of health, education, immigration, the environment, and working-class internationalism. They also criticized the state of racial politics, cultural practices, and the conditions of children and women on the island.</p>
<p>In the chaotic new country, members of the anarchist movement reinterpreted the War for Independence and the revolutionary ideas of patriot Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;, embarking on a nationwide debate with the larger Cuban establishment about what it meant to be &ldquo;Cuban.&rdquo; To counter the dominant culture, the anarchists created their own initiatives&mdash;schools, health institutes, vegetarian restaurants, theater and fiction writing groups, and occasional calls for nudism&mdash;and as a result they challenged both the existing elite and the occupying U.S. military forces.</p>
<p>Shaffer also focuses on what anarchists did to prepare the masses for a social revolution. While many of the Cuban anarchists' ideals flowed from Europe, their programs, criticisms, and literature reflected the specifics of Cuban reality and appealed to Cuba&rsquo;s popular classes. Using theories of working-class internationalism, countercultures, popular culture, and social movements, Shaffer analyzes archival records, pamphlets, newspapers, and novels, showing how the anarchist movement in republican Cuba helped shape the country&rsquo;s early leftist revolutionary agenda.</p>
<p>Shaffer&rsquo;s portrait of the conflict between anarchists and their enemies illuminates the multiple forces that pervaded life on the island in the twentieth century, until the rise of the Gerardo Machado dictatorship in the 1920s. This important book places anarchism in its rightful historical role as a vital current within Cuban radical political culture.</p>"

Haworth,Edited and translated by,Mark Bray,,,,,,,,,24.95,"<p>On October 13, 1909, Francisco Ferrer, the notorious Catalan anarchist educator and founder of the Modern School, was executed by firing squad. The Spanish government accused him of masterminding the Tragic Week rebellion, while the transnational movement that emerged in his defense argued that he was simply the founder of the groundbreaking Modern School of Barcelona. Was Ferrer a ferocious revolutionary, an ardently nonviolent pedagogue, or something else entirely?</p>
<p><em>Anarchist Education and the Modern School</em> is the first historical reader to gather together Ferrer&rsquo;s writings on rationalist education, revolutionary violence, and the general strike (most translated into English for the first time) and put them into conversation with the letters, speeches, and articles of his comrades, collaborators, and critics to show that the truth about the founder of the Modern School was far more complex than most of his friends or enemies realized. Francisco Ferrer navigated a tempestuous world of anarchist assassins, radical republican conspirators, anticlerical rioters, and freethinking educators to establish the legendary Escuela Moderna and the Modern School movement that his martyrdom propelled around the globe.</p>"

Haworth,Afterword by,Allan Antliff,,,,,,,,,,,24.95,"<p>Education is a challenging subject for anarchists. Many are critical about working within a state-run education system that is embedded in hierarchical, standardized, and authoritarian structures. Numerous individuals and collectives envision the creation of counterpublics or alternative educational sites as possible forms of resistance, while other anarchists see themselves as &ldquo;saboteurs&rdquo; within the public arena&mdash;believing that there is a need to contest dominant forms of power and educational practices from multiple fronts. Of course, if anarchists agree that there are no blueprints for education, the question remains, in what dynamic and creative ways can we construct nonhierarchical, anti-authoritarian, mutual, and voluntary educational spaces?</p>
<p>Contributors to this edited volume engage readers in important and challenging issues in the area of anarchism and education. From Francisco Ferrer&rsquo;s modern schools in Spain and the Work People&rsquo;s College in the United States, to contemporary actions in developing &ldquo;free skools&rdquo; in the U.K. and Canada, to direct-action education such as learning to work as a &ldquo;street medic&rdquo; in the protests against neoliberalism, the contributors illustrate the importance of developing complex connections between educational theories and collective actions. Anarchists, activists, and critical educators should take these educational experiences seriously as they offer invaluable examples for potential teaching and learning environments outside of authoritarian and capitalist structures. Major themes in the volume include: learning from historical anarchist experiments in education, ways that contemporary anarchists create dynamic and situated learning spaces, and finally, critically reflecting on theoretical frameworks and educational practices. Contributors include: David Gabbard, Jeffery Shantz, Isabelle Fremeaux &amp; John Jordan, Abraham P. DeLeon, Elsa Noterman, Andre Pusey, Matthew Weinstein, Alex Khasnabish, and many others.</p>"

Goodway argues that a recovered anarchist tradition could&mdash;and should&mdash;be a touchstone for contemporary political radicals. Moving seamlessly from Aldous Huxley and Colin Ward to the war in Iraq, this challenging volume will energize leftist movements throughout the world.</p>"

The volume contains writings going back to his teenage years in Brussels, where he became influenced by the doctrine of individualist anarchism. At the heart of the anthology are key articles written soon after his arrival in Paris in 1909, when he became editor of the newspaper <em>l&rsquo;anarchie</em>. In these articles Serge develops and debates his own radical thoughts, arguing the futility of mass action and embracing &ldquo;illegalism.&rdquo; Serge's involvement with the notorious French group of anarchist armed robbers, the Bonnot Gang, landed him in prison for the first time in 1912. <em>Anarchists Never Surrender</em> includes both his prison correspondence with his anarchist comrade &Eacute;mile Armand and articles written immediately after his release.</p>
<p>The book also includes several articles and letters written by Serge after he had left anarchism behind and joined the Russian Bolsheviks in 1919. Here Serge analyzed anarchism and the ways in which he hoped anarchism would leaven the harshness and dictatorial tendencies of Bolshevism. Included here are writings on anarchist theory and history, Bakunin, the Spanish revolution, and the Kronstadt uprising.</p>
<p><em>Anarchists Never Surrender</em> anthologizes Victor Serge&rsquo;s previously unavailable texts on anarchism and fleshes out the portrait of this brilliant writer and thinker, a man I.F. Stone called one of the &ldquo;moral figures of our time.&rdquo;</p>"

Wilbur,,,,,,,,,,,14.95,"<p>For Emma Goldman, the &ldquo;High Priestess of Anarchy,&rdquo; anarchism was &ldquo;a living force in the affairs of our life, constantly creating new conditions,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the most elemental force in human life&rdquo; was something still more basic and vital: sex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sex Question&rdquo; emerged for Goldman in multiple contexts, and we find her addressing it in writing on subjects as varied as women&rsquo;s suffrage, &ldquo;free love,&rdquo; birth control, the &ldquo;New Woman,&rdquo; homosexuality, marriage, love, and literature. It was at once a political question, an economic question, a question of morality, and a question of social relations.</p>
<p>But her analysis of that most elemental force remained fragmentary, scattered across numerous published (and unpublished) works and conditioned by numerous contexts. <em>Anarchy and the Sex Question</em> draws together the most important of those scattered sources, uniting both familiar essays and archival material, in an attempt to recreate the great work on sex that Emma Goldman might have given us. In the process, it sheds light on Goldman&rsquo;s place in the history of feminism.</p>"

<p>Anarchist ideas are so much at variance with ordinary political assumptions and the solutions anarchists offer so remote, that all too often people find it hard to take anarchism seriously. This classic text is an attempt to bridge the gap between the present reality and anarchist aspirations, &ldquo;between what is and what, according to the anarchists, might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through a wide-ranging analysis&mdash;drawing on examples from education, urban planning, welfare, housing, the environment, the workplace, and the family, to name but a few&mdash;Colin Ward demonstrates that the roots of anarchist practice are not so alien or quixotic as they might at first seem but lie precisely in the ways that people have always tended to organize themselves when left alone to do so.</p>
<p>The result is both an accessible introduction for those new to anarchism and pause for thought for those who are too quick to dismiss it.</p>
<p>For more than thirty years, in over thirty books, Colin Ward patiently explained anarchist solutions to everything from vandalism to climate change&mdash;and celebrated unofficial uses of the landscape as commons, from holiday camps to squatter communities. Ward was an anarchist journalist and editor for almost sixty years, most famously editing the journal <em>Anarchy</em>. He was also a columnist for <em>New Statesman</em>, <em>New Society</em>, <em>Freedom</em>, and <em>Town and Country Planning</em>.</p>"

Just kick it till it breaks.&rdquo;<br /> &mdash; Angry Brigade, communiqu&eacute;.</p>
<p>Between 1970 and 1972 the Angry Brigade used guns and bombs in a series of symbolic attacks against property. A series of communiqu&eacute;s accompanied the actions, explaining the choice of targets and the Angry Brigade philosophy: autonomous organization and attacks on property alongside other forms of militant working class action. Targets included the embassies of repressive regimes, police stations and army barracks, boutiques and factories, government departments and the homes of Cabinet ministers, the Attorney General and the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. These attacks on the homes of senior political figures increased the pressure for results and brought an avalanche of police raids. From the start the police were faced with the difficulty of getting to grips with a section of society they found totally alien. And were they facing an organization&mdash;or an idea? </p>
<p>This documentary, produced by Gordon Carr for the BBC (and first shown in January 1973, shortly after the trial), covers the roots of the Angry Brigade in the revolutionary ferment of the 1960s, and follows their campaign and the police investigation to its culmination in the &ldquo;Stoke Newington 8&rdquo; conspiracy trial at the Old Bailey&mdash;the longest criminal trial in British legal history.

Runaway climate change, the sixth great extinction of planetary life, the acidification of the oceans&mdash;all point toward an era of unprecedented turbulence in humanity&rsquo;s relationship within the web of life. But just what is that relationship, and how do we make sense of this extraordinary transition?</p>
<p><em>Anthropocene or Capitalocene?</em> offers answers to these questions from a dynamic group of leading critical scholars. They challenge the theory and history offered by the most significant environmental concept of our times: the Anthropocene. But are we living in the Anthropocene, literally the &ldquo;Age of Man&rdquo;? Is a different response more compelling, and better suited to the strange&mdash;and often terrifying&mdash;times in which we live? The contributors to this book diagnose the problems of Anthropocene thinking and propose an alternative: the global crises of the twenty-first century are rooted in the Capitalocene, the Age of Capital.</p>
<p><em>Anthropocene or Capitalocene?</em> offers a series of provocative essays on nature and power, humanity, and capitalism. Including both well-established voices and younger scholars, the book challenges the conventional practice of dividing historical change and contemporary reality into &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; and &ldquo;Society,&rdquo; demonstrating the possibilities offered by a more nuanced and connective view of human environment-making, joined at every step with and within the biosphere. In distinct registers, the authors frame their discussions within a politics of hope that signal the possibilities for transcending capitalism, broadly understood as a &ldquo;world-ecology&rdquo; that joins nature, capital, and power as a historically evolving whole.</p>

But until now, the essays collected here, originally published in obscure journals and political magazines, have been largely unavailable to the broad readership to which they are so naturally suited. The opposite of arcane, specialized writing, Morris&rsquo;s work takes an interdisciplinary approach that moves seamlessly among topics, offering up coherent and practical connections between his various scholarly interests and his deeply held commitment to anarchist politics and thought.</p>
<p>Approached in this way, anthropology and ecology are largely untapped veins whose relevance for anarchism and other traditions of social thought have only recently begun to be explored and debated. But there is a long history of anarchist writers drawing upon works in those related fields. Morris&rsquo;s essays both explore past connections and suggest ways that broad currents of anarchist thought will have new and ever-emerging relevance for anthropology and many other ways of understanding social relationships. His writings avoid the constraints of dogma and reach across an impressive array of topics to give readers a lucid orientation within these traditions and point to new ways to confront common challenges.</p>"

Trying to carve out a road between reformism and Bolshevism, the Austromarxists embarked on an ambitious journey towards a socialist oasis in the midst of capitalism. Their showpiece, the legendary &ldquo;Red Vienna,&rdquo; has worked as a model for socialist urban planning ever since.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Austromarxist experiment was the conviction that a socialist revolution had to entail a cultural one. Numerous workers&rsquo; institutions and organizations were founded, from education centers to theaters to hiking associations. With the Fascist threat increasing, the physical aspects of the cultural revolution became ever more central as they were considered mandatory for effective defense. At no other time in socialist history did armed struggle, sports, and sobriety become as intertwined in a proletarian attempt to protect socialist achievements as they did in Austria in the early 1930s. Despite the final defeat of the workers&rsquo; militias in the Austrian Civil War of 1934 and subsequent Fascist rule, the Austromarxist struggle holds important lessons for socialist theory and practice.</p>

It is informed by the author&rsquo;s experience of writing a memoir about his involvement in the London underground scene of the 1960s, the London street commune movement, and the occupation of 144 Piccadilly, an event that hit the world&rsquo;s headlines for ten days in July 1969.</p>
<p>After a brief introduction that sets the contemporary scene of &lsquo;archive fever,&rsquo; the book considers what the political legacy of 1960s counter culture reveals about the process of commemoration. The argument then opens out to discuss the notion of historical legacy and its role in the &lsquo;dialectic of generations&rsquo;. How far can the archive serve as a platform for dialogue and debate between different generations of activists in a culture that fetishises the evanescent present, practices a profound amnesia about its past, and forecloses the sociological imagination of an alternative future? The following section looks at the emergence of a complex apparatus of public fame and celebrity around the spectacle of dissidence and considers whether the Left has subverted or merely mirrored the dominant forms of reputation-making and public recognition. Can the Left establish its own autonomous model of commemoration?</p>
<p>The final section takes up the challenge of outlining a model for the democratic archive as a revisionary project, creating a resource for building collective capacity to sustain struggles of long duration. A postscript examines how archival strategies of the alt-right have intervened at this juncture to elaborate a politics of false memory.</p>"

<p>In 2018, one of the most important spokespersons for the struggle of Kurdish Freedom, Havin Guneser, held three groundbreaking seminars on the historical background and guiding ideology of the movement. Much to the chagrin of career academics, the theoretical foundation of the Kurdish Freedom Movement is far too fluid and dynamic to be neatly stuffed into an ivory-tower filing cabinet. A vital introduction to the Kurdish struggle, <em>The Art of Freedom</em> is the first English-language book to deliver a distillation of the ideas and sensibilities that gave rise to the most important political event of the twenty-first century.</p>

<ul type=""disc"">

<li>&ldquo;Critique and Self-Critique: The rise of the Kurdish freedom movement from the rubbles of two world wars&rdquo; provides an accessible explanation of the origins and theoretical foundation of the movement.</li>

<li>&ldquo;The Rebellion of the Oldest Colony: Jineology&mdash;the Science of Women&rdquo; describes the undercurrents and nuance of the Kurdish women&rsquo;s movement and how they have managed to create the most vibrant and successful feminist movement in the Middle East.</li>

<li>&ldquo;Democratic Confederalism and Democratic Nation: Defense of Society Against Societycide&rdquo; deals with the attacks on the fabric of society and new concepts beyond national liberation to counter it.

From the 1894 Tonghak Uprising through the March 1, 1919, independence movement and anti-Japanese resistance, a direct line is traced to the popular opposition to U.S. division of Korea after World War Two. The overthrow of Syngman Rhee in 1960, resistance to Park Chung-hee, the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, as well as student, labor, and feminist movements are all recounted with attention to their economic and political contexts. South Korean opposition to neoliberalism is portrayed in detail, as is an analysis of neoliberalism&rsquo;s rise and effects. With a central focus on the Gwangju Uprising (that ultimately proved decisive in South Korea&rsquo;s democratization), the author uses Korean experiences as a baseboard to extrapolate into the possibilities of global social movements in the 21st century. </p>
<p>Previous English-language sources have emphasized leaders&mdash;whether Korean, Japanese, or American. This book emphasizes grassroots crystallization of counter-elite dynamics and notes how the intelligence of ordinary people surpasses that of political and economic leaders holding the reins of power. It is the first volume in a two-part study that concludes by analyzing in rich detail uprisings in nine other places: the Philippines, Burma, Tibet, China, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, and Indonesia. Richly illustrated, with tables, charts, graphs, index, and endnotes.</p>"

While the 2011 Arab Spring is well known, the wave of uprisings that swept Asia in the 1980s remain hardly visible. Through a critique of Samuel Huntington&rsquo;s notion of a &ldquo;Third Wave&rdquo; of democratization, the author relates Asian uprisings to predecessors in 1968 and shows their subsequent influence on uprisings in Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s. By empirically reconstructing the specific history of each Asian uprising, significant insight into major constituencies of change and the trajectories of these societies becomes visible.</p>
<p>This book provides detailed histories of uprisings in nine places&mdash;the Philippines, Burma, Tibet, China, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, and Indonesia&mdash;as well as introductory and concluding chapters that place them in a global context and analyze them in light of major sociological theories. Profusely illustrated with photographs, tables, graphs, and charts, it is the definitive, and defining, work from the eminent participant-observer scholar of social movements.</p>"

<p>Through essays, artworks, photographs, infographics, and illustrations, <em>Asylum for Sale: Profit and Protest in the Migration Industry</em> regards the global asylum regime as an industry characterized by profit-making activity: brokers who facilitate border crossings for a fee; contractors and firms that erect walls, fences, and watchtowers while lobbying governments for bigger &ldquo;security&rdquo; budgets; corporations running private detention centers and &ldquo;managing&rdquo; deportations; private lawyers charging exorbitant fees; &ldquo;expert&rdquo; witnesses; and NGO staff establishing careers while placing asylum seekers into new regimes of monitored vulnerability.</p>

<p><em>Asylum for Sale</em> challenges readers to move beyond questions of legal, moral, and humanitarian obligations that dominate popular debates regarding asylum seekers. Digging deeper, the authors focus on processes and actors often overlooked in mainstream analyses and on the trends increasingly rendering asylum available only to people with financial and cultural capital. Probing every aspect of the asylum process from crossings to aftermaths, the book provides an in-depth exploration of complex, international networks, policies, and norms that impact people seeking asylum around the world. In highlighting protest as well as profit, <em>Asylum for Sale</em> presents both critical analyses and proposed solutions for resisting and reshaping current and emerging immigration norms.</p>"

Clark,,,,,,,,,,,19.95,"<p>Following the Zapatista uprising on New Year&rsquo;s Day 1994, the EZLN communities of Chiapas began the slow process of creating a system of autonomous government that would bring their call for freedom, justice, and democracy from word to reality. <em>Autonomy Is in Our Hearts</em> analyzes this long and arduous process on its own terms, using the conceptual language of Tsotsil, a Mayan language indigenous to the highland Zapatista communities of Chiapas.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;Freedom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Democracy&rdquo; emblazoned on the Zapatista flags are only approximations of the aspirations articulated in the six indigenous languages spoken by the Zapatista communities. They are rough translations of concepts such as <em>ichbail ta muk&rsquo;</em> or &ldquo;mutual recognition and respect among equal persons or peoples,&rdquo; <em>a&rsquo;mtel</em> or &ldquo;collective work done for the good of a community&rdquo; and <em>lekil kuxlejal</em> or &ldquo;the life that is good for everyone.&rdquo; <em>Autonomy Is in Our Hearts</em> provides a fresh perspective on the Zapatistas and a deep engagement with the daily realities of Zapatista autonomous government. Simultaneously an exposition of Tsotsil philosophy and a detailed account of Zapatista governance structures, this book is an indispensable commentary on the Zapatista movement of today.</p>"

We were like a tribe. Together we are strong whereas before we felt weak and ostracized.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Barred for Life</em> is a photo documentary cataloging the legacy of Punk Rock pioneers Black Flag, through stories, interviews, and photographs of diehard fans who wear their iconic logo, The Bars, conspicuously tattooed upon their skin. Author Stewart Ebersole provides a personal narrative describing what made the existence of Punk Rock such an important facet of his and many other people&rsquo;s lives, and the role that Black Flag&rsquo;s actions and music played in soundtracking the ups and downs of living as cultural outsiders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The Bars say &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not one of them,&rsquo; and it also lets the right people know that I am one of them.</em>&rdquo;<br /> <br /> Stark black-and-white portraits provide visual testimony to the thesis that Black Flag&rsquo;s factual Punk-pioneering role and their hyper-distilled mythology are now more prevalent worldwide then when the band was in service. An extensive tour of North America and Western Europe documents dedicated fans bearing Bars-on-skin and other Black Flag iconography. Nearly four hundred &ldquo;Barred&rdquo; fans lined up, smiled/frowned for the camera, and issued their stories for the permanent record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It is the black flag of anarchism, and that is the opposite of the white flag of surrender.</em>&rdquo;<br /> <br /> <em>Barred for Life</em> expands its own scope by presenting interviews with former Black Flag members and those close to the band. Interviews with alumni Dez Cadena, Ron Reyes, Kira Roessler, Keith Morris, and Chuck Dukowski, as well as photographers Glen E. Friedman and Ed Colver, and the man responsible for tattooing The Bars on more than a few Black Flag players, Rick Spellman, round out and spotlight aspects of Black Flag&rsquo;s vicious live performances, forward-thinking work ethic, and indisputable reputation for acting as both champions and iconoclastic destroyers of the Punk Rock culture they helped to create.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;<em>When I see The Bars I think &lsquo;Black Flag the band,&rsquo; but they also represent an entire movement of people that are not going to conform. They are part of a culture of people that stand up for themselves.</em>&rdquo;</p>"

Between 2012 and 2018, the &ldquo;Mountain of the Kurds&rdquo; (Kurd Dagh) as the area has been called for centuries, had been one of the quietest regions in a country otherwise torn by civil war.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the Syrian army withdrew from the region in 2012, enabling the Party of Democratic Union (PYD), the Syrian sister party of Abdullah &Ouml;calan&rsquo;s outlawed Turkish Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party (PKK) to first introduce a Kurdish self-administration and then, in 2014, to establish the Canton Afrin as one of the three parts of the heavily Kurdish Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, which is better known under the name Rojava.</p>
<p>This self-administration&mdash;which had seen multiparty municipal and regionwide elections in the summer and autumn of 2017, which included a far-reaching autonomy for a number of ethnic and religious groups, and which had provided a safe haven for up to 300,000 refugees from other parts of Syria&mdash;is now at risk of being annihilated by the Turkish invasion and occupation.</p>
<p>Thomas Schmidinger is one of the very few Europeans to have visited the Canton of Afrin. In this book, he gives an account of the history and the present situation of the region. In a number of interviews, he also gives inhabitants of the region from a variety of ethnicities, religions, political orientations, and walks of life the opportunity to speak for themselves. As things stand now, the book might seem to be in danger of becoming an epitaph for the &ldquo;Mountain of the Kurds,&rdquo; but as the author writes, &ldquo;the battle for the Mountain of the Kurds is far from over yet.&rdquo;</p>"

Kelley,,,,,,,,,,,24.95,"<p>In the early twentieth century, when many US unions disgracefully excluded black and Asian workers, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) warmly welcomed people of color, in keeping with their emphasis on class solidarity and their bold motto: &ldquo;An Injury to One Is an Injury to All!&rdquo; <em>Ben Fletcher: The Life and Times of a Black Wobbly</em> tells the story of one of the greatest heroes of the American working class.</p>

<p>A brilliant union organizer and a humorous orator, Benjamin Fletcher (1890&ndash;1949) was a tremendously important and well-loved African American member of the IWW during its heyday. Fletcher helped found and lead Local 8 of the IWW&rsquo;s Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union, unquestionably the most powerful interracial union of its era, taking a principled stand against all forms of xenophobia and exclusion.</p>

<p>For years, acclaimed historian Peter Cole has carefully researched the life of Ben Fletcher, painstakingly uncovering a stunning range of documents related to this extraordinary man. <em>Ben Fletcher: The Life and Times of a Black Wobbly</em> is the most comprehensive look at Fletcher ever to be published. It includes a detailed biographical sketch of his life and history, reminiscences by fellow workers who knew him, a chronicle of the IWW&rsquo;s impressive decade-long run on the Philadelphia waterfront in which Fletcher played a pivotal role, and nearly all of his known writings and speeches, thus giving Fletcher&rsquo;s timeless voice another opportunity to inspire a new generation of workers, organizers, and agitators. This revised and expanded second edition includes new materials such as facsimile reprints of two extremely rare pamphlets on racism from the early twentieth century, more information on his prison years and personal life, additional recollections from friends, greater consideration of Fletcher from a global perspective, and much more.</p>"

Clark,Foreword by,Peter Marshall,,,,,,,,,,,24.95,"<p><em>Between Earth and Empire</em> focuses on the crucial position of humanity at the present moment in Earth history. We are now in the midst of the Necrocene, an epoch of death and mass extinction. Nearing the end of the long history of Empire and domination, we are faced with the choice of either continuing the path of social and ecological disintegration or initiating a new era of social and ecological regeneration.</p>
<p>The book shows that conventional approaches to global crisis on both the right and the left have succumbed to processes of denial and disavowal, either rejecting the reality of crisis entirely or substituting ineffectual but comforting gestures and images for deep, systemic social transformation. It is argued that a large-scale social and ecological regeneration must be rooted in communities of liberation and solidarity, fostering personal and group transformation so that a culture of awakening and care can emerge.</p>
<p><em>Between Earth and Empire</em> explores examples of significant progress in this direction, including the Zapatista movement in Chiapas, the Democratic Autonomy Movement in Rojava, indigenous movements in defense of the commons, the solidarity economy movement, and efforts to create liberated base communities and affinity groups within anarchism and other radical social movements. In the end, the book presents a vision of hope for social and ecological regeneration through the rebirth of a libertarian and communitarian social imaginary, and the flourishing of a free cooperative community globally.</p>"

It proclaimed itself the &ldquo;Government of Hope&rdquo; and throughout the world symbolized the hope that radical change could be achieved through institutional politics. The referendum of July 2015 rejected the austerity imposed by the banks and the European Union but was followed by a complete reversal of the government&rsquo;s position and its acceptance of that austerity.</p>
<p>The collapse of hope that accompanied the failure of the institutional Left opened the way to the return of the right-wing New Democracy Party, with a more aggressive program than ever. The essays collected in <em>Beyond Crisis</em>, among other things, form a case study of the &ldquo;Greek experiment&rdquo; that points to deeper implications concerning the global upsurge of disillusioned anger that has spurred the rise of far-right populism and support for strong leaders, exclusion of ethnic minorities, and greater &ldquo;racial purity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Syriza government&rsquo;s dramatic crash showed the limits of institutional politics, a lesson apparently overlooked by the enthusiastic followers of Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders. But it also poses profound questions for those who reject state-centered politics. The anarchist or autonomist movement in Greece has been one of the strongest in the world, yet it has failed to have a significant impact in opening up alternative perspectives.</p>
<p>So how do we pick up the pieces? What direction should we follow from now on? How do we understand what happened and learn from it? The essays in this collection do not point to a single conclusion or path forward but rather raise questions that remain open about how to move beyond the current crisis amid a darkening sky of seeming impossibility.</p>"

From his prison cell, Abdullah &#214;calan intervened by penning his most influential work to date: <em>Beyond State, Power, and Violence</em>. With a stunning vision of a freedom movement centered on women&#8217;s liberation, democracy, and ecology, &#214;calan helped reinvigorate the Kurdish freedom movement by providing a revolutionary path forward with what is undoubtedly the furthest-reaching definition of democracy the world has ever seen. Here, for the first time, is the highly anticipated English translation of this monumental work.</p>&#10;&#10;<p><em>Beyond State, Power, and Violence</em> is a breathtaking reconnaissance into life without the state, an essential portrait of the PKK and the Kurdish freedom movement, and an open blueprint for leftist organizing in the twenty-first century, written by one of the most vitally important political luminaries of today.</p>&#10;&#10;<p>By carefully analyzing the past and present of the Middle East, &#214;calan evaluates concrete prospects for the Kurdish people and arrives with his central proposal: recreate the Kurdish freedom movement along the lines of a new paradigm based on the principles of democratic confederalism and democratic autonomy. In the vast scope of this book, &#214;calan examines the emergence of hierarchies and eventually classes in human societies and sketches his alternative, the democratic-ecological society. This vision, with a theoretical foundation of a nonviolent means of taking power, has ushered in a new era for the Kurdish freedom movement while also offering a fresh and indispensable perspective on the global debate about a new socialism. &#214;calan&#8217;s calls for nonhierarchical forms of democratic social organization deserve the careful attention of anyone interested in constructive social thought or rebuilding society along feminist and ecological lines.</p>"

Feminist, antiracist, trans, ecological movements&mdash;all look at the body in its manifold manifestations as a ground of confrontation with the state and a vehicle for transformative social practices. Concurrently, the body has become a signifier for the reproduction crisis the neoliberal turn in capitalist development has generated and for the international surge in institutional repression and public violence. In <em>Beyond the Periphery of the Skin</em>, lifelong activist and best-selling author Silvia Federici examines these complex processes, placing them in the context of the history of the capitalist transformation of the body into a work-machine, expanding on one of the main subjects of her first book, <em>Caliban and the Witch</em>.</p>

<p>Building on three groundbreaking lectures that she delivered in San Francisco in 2015, Federici surveys the new paradigms that today govern how the body is conceived in the collective radical imagination, as well as the new disciplinary regimes state and capital are deploying in response to mounting revolt against the daily attacks on our everyday reproduction. In this process she confronts some of the most important questions for contemporary radical political projects. What does &ldquo;the body&rdquo; mean, today, as a category of social/political action? What are the processes by which it is constituted? How do we dismantle the tools by which our bodies have been &ldquo;enclosed&rdquo; and collectively reclaim our capacity to govern them?</p>"

<p>&ldquo;I could talk about female empowerment, body positivity, and gender flexibility.

The union was a big presence in the labor movement, leading strikes, walkouts, and rallies across the nation. And everywhere its members went, they sang.</p>
<p>Their songs were sung in mining camps and textile mills, hobo jungles and flop houses, and anywhere workers might be recruited to the Wobblies&rsquo; cause. The songs were published in a pocketsize tome called the <em>Little Red Songbook</em>, which was so successful that it&rsquo;s been published continuously since 1909. In <em>The Big Red Songbook</em>, the editors have gathered songs from over three dozen editions, plus additional songs, rare artwork, personal recollections, discographies, and more into one big all-embracing book.</p>
<p>IWW poets/composers strove to nurture revolutionary consciousness. Each piece, whether topical, hortatory, elegiac, or comic served to educate, agitate, and emancipate workers. A handful of Wobbly numbers have become classics, still sung by labor groups and folk singers. They include Joe Hill&rsquo;s sardonic &ldquo;The Preacher and the Slave&rdquo; (sometimes known by its famous phrase &ldquo;Pie in the Sky&rdquo;) and Ralph Chaplin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Solidarity Forever.&rdquo; Songs lost or found, sacred or irreverent, touted or neglected, serious or zany, singable or not, are here. The Wobblies and their friends have been singing for a century. May this comprehensive gathering simultaneously celebrate past battles and chart future goals.</p>
<p>In addition to the 250+ songs, writings are included from Archie Green, Franklin Rosemont, David Roediger, Salvatore Salerno, Judy Branfman, Richard Brazier, James Connell, Carlos Cortez, Bill Friedland, Virginia Martin, Harry McClintock, Fred Thompson, Adam Machado, and many more.</p>"

Serge&rsquo;s tale begins in the spring of 1917, the third year of mass slaughter in the blood-and-rain-soaked trenches of World War I. When the flames of revolution suddenly erupt in Russia and Spain, Europe is &ldquo;burning at both ends.&rdquo; Although the Spanish uprising eventually fizzles, in Russia the workers, peasants, and common soldiers are able to take power and hold it.</p>
<p>Serge&rsquo;s &ldquo;tale of two cities&rdquo; is constructed from the opposition between Barcelona, the city &ldquo;we&rdquo; could not take, and Petrograd, the starving, beleaguered capital of the Russian Revolution besieged by counter-revolutionary Whites. Between the romanticism of radicalized workers awakening to their own power in a sun-drenched Spanish metropolis to the grim reality of workers clinging to power in Russia&rsquo;s dark, frozen revolutionary outpost. From &ldquo;victory in defeat&rdquo; to &ldquo;defeat in victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The novel was composed a decade after the revolution in Leningrad, where Serge was living in semicaptivity because of his declared opposition to Stalin&rsquo;s dictatorship over the revolution.</p>"

Using technical language like &ldquo;age structure,&rdquo; &ldquo;dependency ratio,&rdquo; and &ldquo;entitlement crisis,&rdquo; establishment think tanks are raising the alarm: if U.S. women don&rsquo;t get busy having more children, we&rsquo;ll face an aging workforce, slack consumer demand, and a stagnant economy.</p>
<p>Feminists generally believe that a prudish religious bloc is responsible for the protracted fight over reproductive freedom in the U.S. and that politicians only attack abortion and birth control to appeal to those &ldquo;values voters.&rdquo; But hidden behind this conventional explanation is a dramatic fight over women&rsquo;s reproductive labor. On one side, elite policymakers want an expanding workforce reared with a minimum of employer spending and a maximum of unpaid women&rsquo;s work. On the other side, women are refusing to produce children at levels desired by economic planners. By some measures our birth rate is the lowest it has ever been. With little access to childcare, family leave, health care, and with insufficient male participation, U.S. women are conducting a spontaneous birth strike.</p>
<p>In other countries, panic over low birth rates has led governments to underwrite childbearing and childrearing with generous universal programs, but in the U.S., women have not yet realized the potential of our bargaining position. When we do, it will lead to new strategies for winning full access to abortion and birth control, and for improving the difficult working conditions U.S. parents now face when raising children.</p>"

<p>At a moment when agency over our childbirth experiences is increasingly centralized in the hands of professional elites, <em>Birth Work as Care Work</em> presents creative new ways to reimagine the trajectory of our reproductive processes.

But it offers neither dire predictions nor false hopes. Instead, it embraces the mystery of what might transpire. The word &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; has not always signified &ldquo;disaster&rdquo;; during the sixteenth century, especially in theater, it came to mean &ldquo;a reversal of what is expected.&rdquo; <em>Black Box</em> is ultimately a documentary project, a record of the catastrophe, but it&rsquo;s an open question where the inquiry will take us. It may be a record of the disastrous end. Or it may be a record of the turning.</p>
<p>The first volume contains an eclectic but accessible collection of reportage, interviews, letters, fragments, and theoretical responses from some of the brightest minds in critical theory. Its authors have sent dispatches from American prison yards, the shipping graveyards of India, fatal overseas drone strikes, roads crisscrossing the Mississippi Delta, childhoods in revolutionary Zimbabwe, and kitchens where undocumented workers wash dishes. By taking a broad geographical and aesthetic stance, <em>Black Box</em> will be a constellation of ideas and information that points toward the future&mdash;whatever it may hold.</p>
<p>Contributors to <em>Black Box</em> include scholars (Nina Power, Silvia Federici, Sami Khatib, Chris O&rsquo;Kane, Tanya Erzen), cultural critics (Richard Dyer, Charles Mudede), authors (Ursula K. Le Guin, Miranda Mellis), poets (Emily Abendroth, Cathy Wagner, Alli Warren), and many others.</p>"

With a theory and practice that had much in common with their contemporaries the San Francisco Diggers, Dutch Provos, and the French Situationists&mdash;who famously excommunicated 3 of the 4 members of the British section of the Situationist International for associating too closely with Black Mask&mdash;the group intervened spectacularly in the art, politics and culture of their times. From shutting down the Museum of Modern Art to protesting Wall Street&rsquo;s bankrolling of war, from battling with Maoists at SDS conferences to defending the Valerie Solanas shooting of Andy Warhol, Black Mask successfully straddled the counterculture and politics of the &rsquo;60s, and remained the Joker in the pack of both sides of &ldquo;The Movement.&rdquo; </p>
<p>By 1968 Black Mask dissolved into &ldquo;The Family&rdquo; (popularly known as <em>Up Against The Wall Motherf**ker</em>&mdash;the name to which they signed their first leaflet), which combined the confrontational theater and tactics of Black Mask with a much more aggressively &ldquo;street&rdquo; approach in dealing with the police, and authorities. Dubbed a &ldquo;street gang with analysis&rdquo; they were reputedly the only white grouping taken seriously by the Black Panther Party, and influenced everyone from the Weathermen to the &ldquo;hippy&rdquo; communal movements.</p> <p>This volume collects the complete ten issues of the paper <em>Black Mask</em> (produced from 1966&ndash;1967 by Ben Morea and Ron Hahne), together with a generous collection of the leaflets, articles, and flyers generated by Black Mask, and UATW/MF, the <em>UATW/MF Magazine</em>, and both the <em>Free Press</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em> reports on UATW/MF.

Beyond its clichés of grimness, nihilism, reaction, and signature black/white corpse-paint sneer, black metal today is a vibrant and revolutionary paradigm. This book reveals its ludic, carnival worlds animated by spirits of joy and celebration, community and care, queerness and camp, LGBTQI+ identities and antifascist, antiracist, and left-wing politics, not to mention endless aesthetic experimentation and fabulousness. From the crypt to the cloud, <em>Black Metal Rainbows</em> unearths black metal’s sparkling core and illuminates its prismatic spectrum: deep within the black, far beyond grimness, and over a darkly glittering rainbow!</p>"

The son of anti-czarist exiles in Brussels, Serge was a young anarchist in Paris; a syndicalist rebel in Barcelona; a Bolshevik in Petrograd; a Comintern agent in Central Europe; a comrade of Trotsky&rsquo;s; a friend of writers like Andrei Bely, Boris Pilnyak, and Andr&eacute; Breton; a prisoner of Stalin; a dissident Marxist in exile in Mexico...</p>
<p>Like Serge&rsquo;s extraordinary novels, <em>A Blaze in a Desert: Selected Poems</em> bears witness to decades of revolutionary upheavals in Europe and the advent of totalitarian rule; many of the poems were written during the &ldquo;immense shipwreck&rdquo; of Stalin&rsquo;s ascendancy. In poems datelined Petrograd, Orenburg, Paris, Marseille, the Caribbean, and Mexico, Serge composed elegies for the fallen&mdash;as well as prospective elegies for the living who, like him, endured prison, exile, and bitter disappointment in the revolutions of the first half of the twentieth century:</p>
<p>Night falls, the boat pulls in, <br /> stop singing. <br /> Exile relights its captive lamps<br /> on the shore of time.</p>
<p>Throughout <em>A Blaze in a Desert</em>, Serge draws on the heritage of late- and post-Symbolist writers like Verhaeren, Rictus, Apollinaire, Blok, and Bely&mdash;themselves authors of messages of a more general resistance by the human spirit&mdash;to express the anguish of the failure of the Russian Revolution and to search out glimmers of hope in the ruins of the Second World War.</p>
<p><em>A Blaze in a Desert</em> comprises Victor Serge&rsquo;s sole published book of poetry, <em>Resistance</em> (1938), his unpublished manuscript <em>Messages</em> (1946), and his last poem, &ldquo;Hands&rdquo; (1947).</p>"

Brian",Introduction by,Daniel Ellsberg,,,,,,,,,,,20.00,"<p>&ldquo;We are not worth more, they are not worth less.&rdquo; This is the mantra of S. Brian Willson and the theme that runs throughout his compelling psycho-historical memoir. Willson&rsquo;s story begins in small-town, rural America, where he grew up as a &ldquo;Commie-hating, baseball-loving Baptist,&rdquo; moves through life-changing experiences in Viet Nam, Nicaragua and elsewhere, and culminates with his commitment to a localized, sustainable lifestyle.</p> <p>In telling his story, Willson provides numerous examples of the types of personal, risk-taking, nonviolent actions he and others have taken in attempts to educate and effect political change: tax refusal&mdash;which requires simplification of one&rsquo;s lifestyle; fasting&mdash;done publicly in strategic political and/or therapeutic spiritual contexts; and obstruction tactics&mdash;strategically placing one&rsquo;s body in the way of &ldquo;business as usual.&rdquo; It was such actions that thrust Brian Willson into the public eye in the mid-&rsquo;80s, first as a participant in a high-profile, water-only &ldquo;Veterans Fast for Life&rdquo; against the Contra war being waged by his government in Nicaragua. Then, on a fateful day in September 1987, the world watched in horror as Willson was run over by a U.S. government munitions train during a nonviolent blocking action in which he expected to be removed from the tracks and arrested. </p> <p>Losing his legs only strengthened Willson&rsquo;s identity with millions of unnamed victims of U.S. policy around the world. He provides details of his travels to countries in Latin America and the Middle East and bears witness to the harm done to poor people as well as to the environment by the steamroller of U.S. imperialism. These heart-rending accounts are offered side by side with inspirational stories of nonviolent struggle and the survival of resilient communities</p> <p>Willson&rsquo;s expanding consciousness also uncovers injustices within his own country, including insights gained through his study and service within the U.S. criminal justice system and personal experiences addressing racial injustices. He discusses coming to terms with his identity as a Viet Nam veteran and the subsequent service he provides to others as director of a veterans outreach center in New England. He draws much inspiration from friends he encounters along the way as he finds himself continually drawn to the path leading to a simpler life that seeks to &ldquo;do no harm.&rdquo</p> <p>Throughout his personal journey Willson struggles with the question, &ldquo;Why was it so easy for me, a &rsquo;good&rsquo; man, to follow orders to travel 9,000 miles from home to participate in killing people who clearly were not a threat to me or any of my fellow citizens?&rdquo; He eventually comes to the realization that the &ldquo;American Way of Life&rdquo; is AWOL from humanity, and that the only way to recover our humanity is by changing our consciousness, one individual at a time, while striving for collective cultural changes toward &ldquo;less and local.&rdquo; Thus, Willson offers up his personal story as a metaphorical map for anyone who feels the need to be liberated from the American Way of Life&mdash;a guidebook for anyone called by conscience to question continued obedience to vertical power structures while longing to reconnect with the human archetypes of cooperation, equity, mutual respect and empathy.</p>"

Yet many are still grappling to understand the mutually reinforcing health care challenges that lead to worsened health outcomes. <em>Bodies and Barriers</em> informs health care professionals, students in health professions, policymakers, and fellow activists about these challenges, providing insights and a road map for action that could improve queer health.</p>

<p>Through artfully articulated, data-informed essays by twenty-six well-known and emerging queer activists&mdash;including Alisa Bowman, Jack Harrison-Quintana, Liz Margolies, Robyn Ochs, Sean Strub, Justin Sabia-Tanis, Ryan Thoreson, Imani Woody, and more&mdash;<em>Bodies and Barriers</em> illuminates the health challenges LGBT people experience throughout their lives and challenges conventional wisdom about health care delivery.

At a galvanizing moment when LGBT people have experienced great strides in lived equality, but our health as a community still lags, here is an indispensable blueprint for change by some of the most passionate and important health activists in the LGBT movement today.</p>"

And how a number of young anarchists met in Paris in the years before the First World War, determined to live their lives to the full, regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>Paris in 1911 was a city of riots, strikes, and savage repression of the working class. A stronghold of foreign exiles and homegrown revolutionaries, it was also the base of <em>l&rsquo;anarchie</em>, the outspoken individualist weekly. <em>L&rsquo;anarchie</em> drew together people for whom crime and revolution went hand in hand. There was Victor Kibalchich (later known as Victor Serge), whose inflammatory articles would put him on trial with the rest. Then there was the gang itself: Victor&rsquo;s childhood friend Raymond-La-Science, the tuberculous Andr&eacute; Soudy, the serious-minded Ren&eacute; Valet, Simentoff the southerner, and lastly the prime motivators of the group&mdash;the remorseless Octave Garnier and the experienced Jules Bonnot.

<p>Community and Labor organizer Mitch Troutman brings this explosive and accessible American tale to life through the bootleggers’ own words. Scholars, historians, organizers and activists will celebrate this story of the people who literally seized mountains and stood their ground to create the Equalization movement, the miners’ union democracy movement, and the Communist-led Unemployed Councils of the anthracite region. This epic story of work, love and community stands as a testament to the power of collective action; a story that is sorely needed as communities today rise to confront neoliberal policies ravaging our planet.</p>"

Spanning twenty years, and teeming with vivid characters, <em>Braided Lives</em> tells the powerful, unsentimental story of two young women coming of age.</p>
<p>Jill, fiercely independent, dark, Jewish, an intellectual with Detroit street smarts, is a poet, curious, avid of life&mdash;a &ldquo;professional student&rdquo; and sometime thief. Donna, Jill&rsquo;s cousin and closest friend, is blond, pretty, and alluring. Together, they grow and change at college in Ann Arbor, where the life of poets and painters contrasts sharply with the working-class neighborhood where Jill&rsquo;s family lives.</p>
<p>In Michigan, and afterward in New York City, the two women taste love and betrayal, friendship and pain, independence and fear as they reach a deepening understanding that to control their lives they must fight. And though their fates differ as widely as their personalities, both reflect the danger that sex posed at a time when abortions were illegal and an affair could destroy a woman&rsquo;s life, making the outcome of a chance encounter or a night of love a matter of life and death.</p>
<p><em>Braided Lives</em> is an enduring portrait of the past that has led to our tenuous present. In her new introduction to this edition, Marge Piercy reflects on both the most autobiographical of her novels, and the ongoing battles to ensure the hard-fought victories of the Sixties and Seventies, particularly around sex and reproductive rights.</p>"

Two predominant trends emerge from this social movement-based video activism: 1) anarchist-inflected processes increasingly structure its production, distribution, and exhibition practices; and 2) video does not simply represent collective actions and events, but also serves as a form of activist practice in and of itself from the moment of recording to its later distribution and exhibition. Video plays an increasingly important role among activists in the growing global resistance against neoliberal capitalism. As various radical theorists have pointed out, subjectivity itself becomes a key terrain of struggle as capitalism increasingly structures and mines it through social media sites, cell phone technology, and new &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; work and living patterns. As a result, alternative media production becomes a central location where new collective forms of subjectivity can be created to challenge aspects of neoliberalism.</p>
<p>Chris Rob&eacute;&rsquo;s book fills in historical gaps by bringing to light unexplored video activist groups like the Cascadia Forest Defenders, eco-video activists from Eugene, Oregon; Mobile Voices, Latino day laborers harnessing cell phone technology to combat racism and police harassment in Los Angeles; and Outta Your Backpack Media, indigenous youth from the Southwest who use video to celebrate their culture and fight against marginalization. This groundbreaking study also deepens our understanding of more well-researched movements like AIDS video activism, Paper Tiger Television, and Indymedia by situating them within a longer history and wider context of radical video activism.</p>"

From his solitary jail cell, Abdullah &Ouml;calan has penned daringly innovative works that give profuse evidence of his position as one of the most significant thinkers of our day. His prison writings have mobilized tens of thousands of people and inspired a revolution in the making in Rojava, northern Syria, while also penetrating the insular walls of academia and triggering debate and reflection among countless scholars.</p>
<p>So how do you engage in a meaningful dialogue with Abdullah &Ouml;calan when he has been held in total isolation since April 2015? You compile a book of essays written by a globally diverse cast of the most imaginative luminaries of our time, send it to &Ouml;calan&rsquo;s jailers, and hope that they deliver it to him.</p>
<p>Featured in this extraordinary volume are over a dozen writers, activists, dreamers, and scholars whose ideas have been investigated in &Ouml;calan&rsquo;s own writings. Now these same people have the unique opportunity to enter into a dialogue with his ideas. <em>Building Free Life</em> is a rich and wholly original exploration of the most critical issues facing humanity today. In the broad sweep of this one-of-a-kind dialogue, the contributors explore topics ranging from democratic confederalism to women&rsquo;s revolution, from the philosophy of history to the crisis of the capitalist system, from religion to Marxism and anarchism, all in an effort to better understand the liberatory social forms that are boldly confronting capitalism and the state.</p>
<p>There can be no boundaries or restrictions for the development of thought. Thus, in the midst of different realities&mdash;from closed prisons to open-air prisons&mdash;the human mind will find a way to seek the truth. <em>Building Free Life</em> stands as a monument of radical thought, a testament of resilience, and a searchlight illuminating the impulse for freedom.</p>

In order to wrest complete control over the globe and feed a rapacious thirst for resources and wealth, the American ruling elite is wreaking havoc around the world. Meanwhile, average Americans are suffering, legs trembling under a mountain of debt as they toil at unfulfilling, underpaying jobs. And those with enough time and energy to get angry and fight back are told that the answer is to vote for one of the two pro-war, pro&ndash;Wall Street corporate parties claiming to be their savior.</p>
<p>This epic tragedy does not sound like the beginning of a joke. But somehow comedian and TV host Lee Camp makes it both funny and interesting. Whether he is setting his sights on the scandal of $21 trillion worth of unaccounted-for financial adjustments at the Pentagon or the scorching environmental and human tragedy caused by climate chaos, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that one of our most incisive political commentators is technically a comedian. Camp knifes his way through the jungle of fake news, alternative facts, mainstream media lies, and government blackouts, trailblazing a path between Hunter S. Thompson and Jon Stewart.</p>
<p>Perhaps the present-day story of America can only accurately be told by a comedian, otherwise no one would believe it. In a world where con men are heralded as leaders, locking up peace activists is perceived as justice, trumpeting state propaganda is considered journalism, and mocking environmentalists is championed as strength, it&rsquo;s only appropriate that a comedian is viewed as more reliable than the evening news.</p>"

Led by the Catholic priests Phil and Dan Berrigan, the Catholic Left quickly became one of the most important sectors of the Vietnam War&ndash;era peace movement after a nonviolent raid on a draft board in Catonsville, MD, in May 1968.</p>
<p>With an overview of the broader draft resistance movement, <em>Burglar for Peace</em> is an exploration of the sweeping landscape of the American Left during the Vietnam War era as we accompany Ted Glick on a journey through his personal evolution from typical, white, middle-class, American teenager to an antiwar, nonviolent draft resister. Glick vividly recounts the development of the Catholic Left as it organized scores of nonviolently disruptive, effective actions inside draft boards, FBI offices, war corporation offices, and other sites. <em>Burglar for Peace</em> is the first in-depth, inside look at one of the major political trials of Catholic Left activists, in Rochester, NY, in 1970, as well as a second one in 1972 in Harrisburg, PA. With great humility, Glick recalls how his selfless devotion to ending the war in Vietnam resulted in his eleven months of imprisonment, which included a thirty-four-day hunger strike, and he tells the remarkable story of a Catholic Left-organized, forty-day hunger strike against the war. Concluding the story is a reflective account of Glick&rsquo;s open resignation from the Catholic Left in 1974, his eighteen-year estrangement from Phil and Dan Berrigan, and the eventual healing of that relationship. The final chapter relates timeless lessons learned by the author that will find deep resonance among activists today.</p>
<p><em>Burglar for Peace</em> will serve as both an inspiration and an invaluable resource for those committed to transformational, revolutionary change.</p>"

Beginning in the mid-nineties, Burian distributed his work through the tight-knit network of the DIY punk music scene. <em>Burn Collector</em> caught on because of its unusual content&mdash;in a scene rife with dogmatic political diatribes and bland record reviews, Burian presented his readers with humorous anecdotes, philosophical musings, and nuanced descriptions of odd locales and curious characters, taken mostly from outside of the punk milieu&mdash;and also because of the author&rsquo;s narrative voice, which reflected the literary influences of Celine, Henry Miller, or even David Sedaris more than the influence of his contemporaries in the zine world. The writing in <em>Burn Collector</em> blueprinted a post-punk persona that was smart, strange, political but not correct, attached to subculture, but striving also for a connection to the world at large, and to the greater themes of human existence.</p> 
<p>The book went through six printings, along the way garnering acclaim from readers, inspiring a film (Matt McCormick&rsquo;s 2009, <em>Some Days are Better than Others</em>) and a major label album (Thrice&rsquo;s 2003, <em>The Artist in the Ambulance</em>). More importantly, the book inspired readers to write and self-publish: to do it themselves, in the true punk spirit.</p>"

Yet many people are still grasping to understand these multiple crises and to find a way forward to a just future. Into the breach come the essential insights of <em>Capital and Its Discontents</em>, which cut through the gristle to get to the heart of the matter about the nature of capitalism and imperialism, capitalism&rsquo;s vulnerabilities at this conjuncture&mdash;and what can we do to hasten its demise.</p>
<p>Through a series of incisive conversations with some of the most eminent thinkers and political economists on the Left&mdash;including David Harvey, Ellen Meiksins Wood, Mike Davis, Leo Panitch, Tariq Ali, and Noam Chomsky&mdash;<em>Capital and Its Discontents</em> illuminates the dynamic contradictions undergirding capitalism and the potential for its dethroning. The book challenges conventional wisdom on the Left about the nature of globalization, neoliberalism, and imperialism, as well as the agrarian question in the Global South. It probes deeply into the roots of the global economic meltdown, the role of debt and privatization in dampening social revolt, and considers capitalism&rsquo;s dynamic ability to find ever new sources of accumulation&mdash;whether through imperial or ecological plunder or the commodification of previously unpaid female labor.</p>
<p>The Left luminaries in <em>Capital and Its Discontents</em> look at potential avenues out of the mess&mdash;as well as wrong turns and needless detours&mdash;drawing lessons from the history of post-colonial states in the Global South, struggles against imperialism past and present, the eternal pendulum swing of radicalism, the corrosive legacy of postmodernism, and the potentialities of the radical humanist tradition. At a moment when capitalism as a system is more reviled than ever, here is an indispensable toolbox of ideas for action by some of the most brilliant thinkers of our times.</p>

The world is reeling from the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression, with the threat of further meltdowns ever-looming. Global warming and myriad dire ecological disasters worsen&mdash;with little if any action to halt them&mdash;their effects rippling across the planet in the shape of almost biblical floods, fires, droughts, and hurricanes. Governments warn that there is no alternative to the bitter medicine they prescribe&mdash;or risk devastating financial or social collapse. The right, whether religious or secular, views the present as catastrophic and wants to turn the clock back. The left fears for the worst, but hopes some good will emerge from the rubble. Visions of the apocalypse and predictions of impending doom abound. Across the political spectrum, a culture of fear reigns.?</p>
<p><em>Catastrophism</em> explores the politics of apocalypse&mdash;on the left and right, in the environmental movement&mdash;and examines why the lens of catastrophe can distort our understanding of the dynamics at the heart of these numerous disasters&mdash;and fatally impede our ability to transform the world. Lilley, McNally, Yuen, and Davis probe the reasons why catastrophic thinking is so prevalent, and challenge the belief that it is only out of the ashes that a better society may be born. The authors argue that those who care about social justice and the environment should jettison doomsaying&mdash;even as it relates to indisputably apocalyptic climate change. Far from calling people to arms, they suggest, catastrophic fear often results in passivity and paralysis&mdash;and, at worst, reactionary politics.?</p>"

From early 20th-century factory strikes and occupations, armed anarchist militias, and attempts on Mussolini&rsquo;s life, to postwar student and labor protest, and confronting the newest wave of contemporary neofascist violence sweeping Europe, the Discordias navigate the decades of political, economic, and social turmoil. Against this historical backdrop, Antonio falls in love with Cinka, a proud but poverty-stricken Romani refugee from the &ldquo;unwanted people,&rdquo; without a country or home, forced to flee again and again searching for peace.

<p>Told from the points of view of five different women who cross paths with Luba over four decades, <em>Clandestine Occupations</em> explores the difficult decisions that activists confront about the boundaries of legality and speculates about the scope of clandestine action in the future. It is a thought-provoking reflection on the risks and sacrifices of political activism as well as the damaging reverberations of disaffection and cynicism.</p>"

<p>Established in 1976 at the fore London’s punk rock insurgence, The Clash would outlast their peers while creating some of the most influential albums in rock ’n’ roll history. Author Martin Popoff dissects each of the Clash’s ninety-one studio tracks, examining the circumstances that led to their creation, the recording processes, the historical contexts and more. In addition, introductory essays set the scene for the band’s six studio releases (including the double LP <em>London Calling</em> and the triple <em>Sandinista!</em>) and feature sidebars detailing studios, release dates, personnel, and more. Illustrated with rare performance and offstage photography, along with images of 7-inch singles sleeves and gig posters, the resulting volume is a fitting tribute to the foursome whose staunch political stance and groundbreaking amalgam of punk, rockabilly, reggae, and hip-hop earned the title “The Only Band That Matters.”</p>"

It is the history of the giddy years of political change and hope in 1930s Spain, when the so-called &lsquo;Generation of &rsquo;36&rsquo;, Peirats&rsquo; own generation, rose up against the oppressive structures of Spanish society. It is also a history of a revolution that failed, crushed in the jaws of its enemies on both the reformist left and the reactionary right.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; Peirats&rsquo; account is effectively the official CNT history of the war, passionate, partisan but, above all, intelligent. Its huge sweeping canvas covers all areas of the anarchist experience&mdash;the spontaneous militias, the revolutionary collectives, the moral dilemmas occasioned by the clash of revolutionary ideals and the stark reality of the war effort against Franco and his German Nazi and Italian Fascist allies. </p>

At the heart of this vast foray into toppling entrenched forms of domination and centralised control was the flourishing of an array of worker-run collectives in industry, agriculture, public services, and beyond.</p>
<p><em>Collectives in the Spanish Revolution</em> is a unique account of this transformative process&mdash;a work combining impeccable research and analysis with lucid reportage. Its author, Gaston Leval, was not only a participant in the Revolution and a dedicated anarcho-syndicalist but an especially knowledgeable eyewitness to the many industrial and agrarian collectives. In documenting the collectives&rsquo; organisation and how they improved working conditions and increased output, Leval also gave voice to the workers who made them, recording their stories and experiences. At the same time, Leval did not shy away from exploring some of the collectives&rsquo; failings, often ignored in other accounts of the period, opening space for readers today to critically draw lessons from the Spanish experience with self-managed collectives.</p>
<p>The book opens with an insightful examination of pre-revolutionary economic conditions in Spain that gave rise to the worker and peasant initiatives Leval documents and analyses in the bulk of his study. He begins by surveying agrarian collectives in Arag&oacute;n, Levante, and Castile. Leval then guides the reader through an incredible variety of urban examples of self-organisation, from factories and workshops to medicine, social services, Barcelona&rsquo;s tramway system, and beyond. He concludes with a brief but perceptive consideration of the broader political context in which workers carried out such a far-reaching revolution in social organisation&mdash;and a rumination on who and what was responsible for its defeat.</p>
<p>This classic translation of the French original by Vernon Richards is presented in this edition for the first time with an index. A new introduction by Pedro Garc&iacute;a-Guirao and a preface by Stuart Christie offer a pr&eacute;cis of Leval&rsquo;s life and methods, placing his landmark study in the context of more recent writing on the Spanish collectives&mdash;eloquently positing that Leval&rsquo;s account of collectivism and his assessments of their achievements and failings still have a great deal to teach us today.</p>"

Is there anything we can do? What can put us on the course from mutual destruction to common preservation? In the past, social movements have sometimes made rapid and unexpected changes that countered apparently incurable social problems. Jeremy Brecher presents scores of historical examples of people who changed history by adopting strategies of common preservation, showing what we can we learn from past social movements to better confront today&rsquo;s global threats of climate change, war, and economic chaos.</p>

<p>Under socialism until the mid-1970s, during the ensuing transition until the mid-1990s, and in the capitalist period since, the CCP regime responded to the struggles of workers, peasants, migrants, and women* with a mix of repression, concession, cooptation, and reform. Ralf Ruckus shows that this dynamic took the country into a new phase each time&mdash;and eventually all the way from socialism to capitalism: in the 1950s, labor struggles and the Hundred Flowers Movement were followed by the regime&rsquo;s Great Leap Forward; in the 1960s, the Cultural Revolution led to the CCP&rsquo;s failed attempt to revitalize socialism; in the 1970s, social unrest and movements for a democratic socialism made room for the regime&rsquo;s Reform and Opening policies; in the late 1980s, the Tian&rsquo;anmen Square uprising triggered more radical reforms; in the 1990s, peasant and state worker unrest could not stop the capitalist restructuring; and in the 2000s, migrant worker struggles led to concessions, tightened repression, and the regime&rsquo;s global capitalist expansion strategy in the 2010s.</p>
<p><em>The Communist Road to Capitalism</em> breaks with established orthodoxies about the PRC&rsquo;s socialist &ldquo;successes&rdquo; and myths on its later rise as an economic power. It combines a historiography of workers&rsquo;, peasants&rsquo;, migrants&rsquo;, and women*&rsquo;s struggles with a searing critique of exploitation, authoritarian state power and gender discrimination under socialism and capitalism. Drawing lessons from PRC history, Ralf Ruckus finally outlines political aims and methods for the left that avoid past mistakes and allow to fight on for a society free of all forms of exploitation and oppression.</p>"

Compiled by the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, each chapter reflects different frameworks for understanding the Bay Area&rsquo;s ongoing urban upheaval, including: evictions and root shock, indigenous geographies, health and environmental racism, state violence, transportation and infrastructure, migration and relocation, and speculative futures. By weaving these themes together, <em>Counterpoints</em> expands normative urban-studies framings of gentrification to consider more complex, regional, historically grounded, and entangled horizons for understanding the present. Understanding the tech boom and its effects means looking beyond San Francisco&rsquo;s borders to consider the region as a socially, economically, and politically interconnected whole and reckoning with the area&rsquo;s deep history of displacement, going back to its first moments of settler colonialism. <em>Counterpoints</em> combines work from within the project with contributions from community partners, from longtime community members who have been fighting multiple waves of racial dispossession to elementary school youth envisioning decolonial futures. In this way, <em>Counterpoints</em> is a collaborative, co-created atlas aimed at expanding knowledge on displacement and resistance in the Bay Area with, rather than for or about, those most impacted.</p>"

These concerted efforts to spy on Americans and undermine meaningful social change are greatly enhanced by the coordination of numerous local, state, and federal agencies often operating at the behest of private corporations. Normally associated with the realities of a post-9/11 world, <em>Crashing the Party</em> shows how these developments were already being set in motion during the Republican National Convention (RNC) protests in 2000. It also documents how, in response, dissidents confronted new forms of political repression by pushing legal boundaries and establishing new models of collective resistance.</p>
<p><em>Crashing the Party</em> explains how the events of 2000 acted as a testing ground in which Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney was able to develop repressive methods of policing that have been used extensively across the U.S. ever since. At the same time, these events also provided a laboratory for the radical, innovative, and confrontational forms of legal support carried out by R2K Legal, a defendant-led collective that raised unprecedented amounts of money for legal defense, used a unique form of court solidarity to overcome hundreds of serious charges, and implemented a PR campaign that turned the tide of public opinion in favor of dissidents. While much has been written about the global-justice era of struggle, little attention has been paid to the legal struggles of the period or the renewed use of solidarity tactics in jail and the courtroom that made them possible. By analyzing the successes and failures of these tactics, <em>Crashing the Party</em> offers rare insight into the mechanics and concrete effects of such resistance. In this way, it is an invaluable resource for those seeking to confront today&rsquo;s renewed counterintelligence tactics.</p>"

Combining veterans of the prisoners&rsquo; women&rsquo;s, gay, and black liberation movements, this organization was also ideologically diverse, consisting of both communists and anarchists. Concomitant with the Brigade&rsquo;s extensive armed work were prolific public communications. In more than a dozen communiqu&eacute;s and a substantial political statement, they sought to explain their intentions to the public while defying the law enforcement agencies that pursued them. </p> 
<p> <em>Creating a Movement with Teeth</em> makes available this body of propaganda and mediations on praxis, collecting it in one volume for the first time. In addition, the collection assembles corporate media profiles of the organization&rsquo;s members and alternative press articles in which partisans thrash out the heated debates sparked in the progressive community by the eruption of an armed group in their midst. <em>Creating a Movement with Teeth</em> illuminates a forgotten chapter of the radical social movements of the 1970s in which diverse interests combined forces in a potent rejection of business as usual in the United States.</p>"

Activist contributors Zephyr Williams, Mark Travis Rivera, Jamie Gliksburg, Denise Spivak, Emmett Patterson, Omar Gonzales-Pagan, Kenyon Farrow, and more provide a radical lens through which future activists can consider effective strategies to make change, even or perhaps especially, during periods of crisis. <br></p>"

An erudite new introduction by Peter Hudis plumbs the depth of Marx&rsquo;s argument, elucidating how his vision of communism, and the transition to it, was thoroughly democratic.

Kelley,Illustrated by,André Trantraal,Illustrated by,Nathan Trantraal,Illustrated by,Ashley E. Marais,,,,,20.00,"<p>Drawn by South African political cartoonists the Trantraal brothers and Ashley Marais, <em>Crossroads: I Live Where I Like</em> is a graphic nonfiction history of women-led movements at the forefront of the struggle for land, housing, water, education, and safety in Cape Town over half a century. Drawing on over sixty life narratives, it tells the story of women who built and defended Crossroads, the only informal settlement that successfully resisted the apartheid bulldozers in Cape Town. The story follows women&rsquo;s organized resistance from the peak of apartheid in the 1970s to ongoing struggles for decent shelter today. Importantly, this account was workshopped with contemporary housing activists and women&rsquo;s collectives who chose the most urgent and ongoing themes they felt spoke to and clarified challenges against segregation, racism, violence, and patriarchy standing between the legacy of the colonial and apartheid past and a future of freedom still being fought for.</p>

<p>Presenting dramatic visual representations of many personalities and moments in the daily life of this township, the book presents a thoughtful and thorough chronology, using archival newspapers, posters, photography, pamphlets, and newsletters to further illustrate the significance of the struggles at Crossroads for the rest of the city and beyond. This collaboration has produced a beautiful, captivating, accessible, forgotten, and in many ways uncomfortable history of Cape Town that has yet to be acknowledged.</p>

<p><em>Crossroads: I Live Where I Like</em> raises questions critical to the reproduction of segregation and to gender and generational dynamics of collective organizing, to ongoing anticolonial struggles and struggles for the commons, and to new approaches to social history and creative approaches to activist archives.</p>"

Grey Walter, and both his grandfathers had known Peter Kropotkin and Edward Carpenter. However, it was the twin jolts of Suez and the Hungarian Revolution while still a student, followed by participation in the resulting New Left and nuclear disarmament movement, that led him to anarchism himself. His personal history is recounted in two autobiographical pieces in this collection as well as the editor&rsquo;s introduction.</p> 
<p>During the 1960s he was a militant in the British nuclear disarmament movement&mdash;especially its direct-action wing, the Committee of 100&mdash;he was one of the Spies for Peace (who revealed the State&rsquo;s preparations for the governance of Britain after a nuclear war), he was close to the innovative Solidarity Group and was a participant in the homelessness agitation. Concurrently with his impressive activism he was analyzing acutely and lucidly the history, practice and theory of these intertwined movements; and it is such writings&mdash;including <em>Non-violent Resistance</em> and <em>The Spies for Peace and After</em>&mdash;that form the core of this book. But there are also memorable pieces on various libertarians, including the writers George Orwell, Herbert Read and Alan Sillitoe, the publisher C.W. Daniel and the maverick Guy A. Aldred. <em>The Right to be Wrong</em> is a notable polemic against laws limiting the freedom of expression. Other than anarchism, the passion of Walter&rsquo;s intellectual life was the dual cause of atheism and rationalism; and the selection concludes appropriately with a fine essay on <em>Anarchism and Religion</em> and his moving reflections, <em>Facing Death</em>.</p>
<p> Nicolas Walter scorned the pomp and frequent ignorance of the powerful and detested the obfuscatory prose and intellectual limitations of academia. He himself wrote straightforwardly and always accessibly, almost exclusively for the anarchist and freethought movements. The items collected in this volume display him at his considerable best.</p>"

With its focus on speculation, alternate worlds and the future, science fiction became an ideal vessel for this upsurge of radical protest.</p>



<p><em>Dangerous Visions and New Worlds: Radical Science Fiction, 1950 to 1985</em> details, celebrates, and evaluates how science fiction novels and authors depicted, interacted with, and were inspired by these cultural and political movements in America and Great Britain. It starts with progressive authors who rose to prominence in the conservative 1950s, challenging the so-called Golden Age of science fiction and its linear narratives of technological breakthroughs and space-conquering male heroes. The book then moves through the 1960s, when writers, including those in what has been termed the New Wave, shattered existing writing conventions and incorporated contemporary themes such as modern mass media culture, corporate control, growing state surveillance, the Vietnam War, and rising currents of counterculture, ecological awareness, feminism, sexual liberation, and Black Power. The 1970s, when the genre reflected the end of various dreams of the long Sixties and the faltering of the postwar boom, is also explored along with the first half of the 1980s, which gave rise to new subgenres, such as cyberpunk.</p>



<p><em>Dangerous Visions and New Worlds</em> contains over twenty chapters written by contemporary authors and critics, and hundreds of full-color cover images, including thirteen thematically organised cover selections. New perspectives on key novels and authors, such as Octavia Butler, Ursula K. Le Guin, Philip K. Dick, Harlan Ellison, John Wyndham, Samuel Delany, J.G. Ballard, John Brunner, Judith Merril, Barry Malzberg, Joanna Russ, and many others are presented alongside excavations of topics, works, and writers who have been largely forgotten or undeservedly ignored.</p>"

Smith,Author,André Moncourt,,,,,,,,,,,5.95,"<p>In 1970 a small group of West German revolutionaries decided to go underground, set up safe houses, and learn the skills of the urban guerilla. They were the Red Army Faction.</p> <p> Seven years later, almost all of the original combatants were in prison or dead, yet, through their example, they had inspired a militant and illegal support movement, comrades willing to take up arms in defense of the prisoners.</p> <p> 1977 was to be a year of reckoning. Through daring attacks and devastating errors, the West German guerilla brought their society to the brink, mounting one of the most desperate and incredible campaigns of asymmetrical warfare ever waged in postwar Europe. That they failed is no excuse to not learn their story, to see who they were and what they fought for&mdash;and, most tragically, to bear witness to the lengths the state would go to silence them. This pamphlet is our very modest introduction to this story.</p>"

<p>If the colorful &rsquo;80s punk bands captured in <em>Burning Britain</em> were loud, political, and uncompromising, those examined in <em>The Day the Country Died</em> were even more so, totally prepared to risk their liberty to communicate the ideals they believed in so passionately.</p>
<p>With Crass and Poison Girls opening the floodgates, the arrival of bands such as Zounds, Flux of Pink Indians, Conflict, Subhumans, Chumbawamba, Amebix, Rudimentary Peni, Antisect, Omega Tribe, and Icons of Filth heralded a brand new age of honesty and integrity in underground music. With a backdrop of Thatcher&rsquo;s Britain, punk music became self-sufficient and considerably more aggressive, blending a DIY ethos with activism to create the perfectly bleak soundtrack to the zeitgeist of a discontented British youth.</p>
<p>It was a time when punk stopped being merely a radical fashion statement, and became a force for real social change; a genuine revolutionary movement, driven by some of the most challenging noises ever committed to tape. Anarchy, as regards punk rock, no longer meant &ldquo;cash from chaos.&rdquo; It meant &ldquo;freedom, peace, and unity.&ldquo; Anarcho punk took the rebellion inherent in punk from the beginning to a whole new level of personal awareness.</p>
<p>All the scene&rsquo;s biggest names, and most of the smaller ones, are comprehensively covered with new, exclusive interviews and hundreds of previously unseen photographs.</p>"

Djeli Clark,,,,,,,,,15.95,"<p>The year is 1923. The Ku Klux Klan is at the height of its power in the US as membership swells into the millions and they expand beyond their original southern borders. As they grow, so do their targets. As they continue their campaigns of terror against African Americans, their list now includes Catholics and Jews, southern and eastern Europeans, all in the name of &ldquo;white supremacy.&rdquo; But they are no longer considered a terrorist organization. By adding the messages of moral decency, family values, and temperance, the Klan has slapped on a thin veneer of respectability and has become a &ldquo;civic organization,&rdquo; attracting ordinary citizens, law enforcement, and politicians to their particular brand of white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant &ldquo;Americanism.&rdquo;</p>







<p>Pennsylvania enthusiastically joined that wave. That was when the Grand Dragon of Pennsylvania decided to display the Klan&rsquo;s newfound power in a show of force. He chose a small town outside of Pittsburgh named after Andrew Carnegie; a small, unassuming borough full of &ldquo;Catholics and Jews,&rdquo; the perfect place to teach these immigrants &ldquo;a lesson.&rdquo; Some thirty thousand members of the Klan gathered from as far as Kentucky for &ldquo;Karnegie Day.&rdquo; After initiating new members, they armed themselves with torches and guns to descend upon the town to show them exactly what Americanism was all about.</p>







<p><em>The Day the Klan Came to Town</em> is a fictionalized retelling of the riot, focusing on a Sicilian immigrant, Primo Salerno. He is not a leader; he&rsquo;s a man with a troubled past. He was pulled from the sulfur mines of Sicily as a teen to fight in the First World War. Afterward, he became the focus of a local fascist and was forced to emigrate to the United States. He doesn&rsquo;t want to fight but feels that he may have no choice. The entire town needs him&mdash;and indeed everybody&mdash;to make a stand.</p>"

Their debut full-length, <em>Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables</em>, in particular, is regularly voted among the top albums in the genre. <em>Fresh Fruit</em> offered a perfect hybrid of humor and polemic strapped to a musical chassis that was as tetchy and inventive as Jello Biafra&rsquo;s withering broadsides. Those lyrics, cruel in their precision, were revelatory. But it wouldn&rsquo;t have worked if the underlying sonics were not such an uproarious rush, the paraffin to Biafra&rsquo;s naked flame.</p>
<p>Dead Kennedys&rsquo; continuing influence is an extraordinary achievement for a band that had practically zero radio play and only released records on independent labels. They not only existed outside of the mainstream but were, as V. Vale of <em>Search and Destroy</em> noted, the first band of their stature to turn on and attack the music industry itself. The DKs set so much in motion. They were integral to the formulation of an alternative network that allowed bands on the first rung of the ladder to tour outside of their own backyard. They were instrumental in supporting the concept of all-ages shows and spurned the advances of corporate rock promoters and industry lapdogs. They legitimized the notion of an American punk band touring internationally while disseminating the true horror of their native country&rsquo;s foreign policies, effectively serving as anti-ambassadors on their travels.</p>
<p>The book uses dozens of first-hand interviews, photos, and original artwork to offer a new perspective on a group who would become mired in controversy almost from the get-go. It applauds the band&rsquo;s key role in transforming punk rhetoric, both polemical and musical, into something genuinely threatening&mdash;and enormously funny. The author offers context in terms of both the global and local trajectory of punk and, while not flinching from the wildly differing takes individual band members have on the evolution of the band, attempts to be celebratory&mdash;if not uncritical.</p>"

<p><em>Death to Bourgeois Society</em> tells the story of four young anarchists who were guillotined in France in the 1890s. Their courage was motivated by noble ideals whose realization they saw their bombs and assassinations as hastening. In a time of cynicism and political decay for many, they represented a purity lacking in society, and their actions when they were captured, their forthrightness, their defiance up to the guillotine only added to their luster.</p>
<p>The texts collected in <em>Death to Bourgeois Society</em> focus on the main avatars of this movement: the grave robber/murderer/terrorist Ravachol; Auguste Vaillant, who bombed the Chamber of Deputies; Emile Henry, who attacked both the bourgeois in their class function and their very existence; and the Italian immigrant Santo Caserio, who brought down the curtain on the age when he assassinated the French president Sadi Carnot.</p>
<p>The volume contains key first person narratives of the events, from Ravachol&rsquo;s forbidden speech and his account of his life, to Henry&rsquo;s questioning at his trial and his programmatic letter to the director of the prison in which he was held, to Vaillant&rsquo;s confrontation with the investigators immediately after tossing his bomb, and Caserio&rsquo;s description of the assassination and his defense at his trial.</p>"

Increasingly, we are forced to take on debt to meet our needs&mdash;from housing, to education, to medical care. The results&mdash;wrecked lives, devastated communities, and an increasing reliance on credit to maintain our basic living standards&mdash;reveal an economic system that enriches the few at the expense of the many.</p>

Over two centuries after the Great French Revolution, Raoul Vaneigem writes that today, &ldquo;in a situation comparable to the condition of France on the eve of its Revolution,&rdquo; we cannot limit ourselves to demanding liberties&mdash;the so-called bourgeois freedoms&mdash;that came into being with free trade, for now the free exchange of capital is the totalitarian form of a system which reduces human beings and the earth itself to merchandise. The time has come to give priority to the real individual rather than to Man in the abstract, the citizen answerable to the State and to the sole dictates of God&rsquo;s successor, the economy.</p>
<p>Sometimes playful or poetic, always provocative, Vaneigem reviews the history of bills of rights before offering his own call, with commentary, for fifty-eight rights yet to be won in a world where the &ldquo;freedoms accorded to Man&rdquo; are no longer merely &ldquo;the freedoms accorded by man to the economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every human being has the right, for example: to become human and to be treated as such; to dispose freely of their time; to comfort and luxury; to free modes of transport set up by and for the collectivity; to permanent control over scientific experimentation; to association by affinity; to bend toward life what was turned toward death; to the flux of passions and the freedoms of love; to a natural life and a natural death; to hold nothing sacred; to excess and to moderation; to desire what seems beyond the realm of the possible.</p>
<p>Readers of Vaneigem&rsquo;s now-classic work <em>The Revolution of Everyday Life</em> will find much to engage with in this unique work of subversive utopianism.</p>"

It explores the key anarchist concepts of society and the state, freedom and equality, authority and power, and investigates the successes and failure of the anarchist movements throughout the world. While remaining sympathetic to anarchism, it presents a balanced and critical account. It covers not only the classic anarchist thinkers, such as Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Reclus and Emma Goldman, but also other libertarian figures, such as Nietzsche, Camus, Gandhi, Foucault and Chomsky. No other book on anarchism covers so much so incisively.</p>
<p>In this updated edition, a new epilogue examines the most recent developments, including &ldquo;post-anarchism&rdquo; and &ldquo;anarcho-primitivism&rdquo; as well as the anarchist contribution to the peace, green and Global Justice movements.</p>
<p><em>Demanding the Impossible</em> is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand what anarchists stand for and what they have achieved. It will also appeal to those who want to discover how anarchism offers an inspiring and original body of ideas and practices which is more relevant than ever in the twenty-first century.</p>"

Smith,Author,William E. Trautmann,Edited by,Salvatore Salerno,,,,,,,14.95,"<p>The pamphlets reprinted here were first published in the 1910s amid great controversy. Even then, the tactics of direct action and sabotage were often associated with the cartoonists&rsquo; image of the disheveled, wild-eyed anarchist armed with stiletto, handgun, or bomb&mdash;the clandestine activity of a militant minority or the desperate acts of the unorganized.</p>
<p>The activist authors of the texts in this collection challenged the prevailing stereotypes. As they point out, the practices of direct action and sabotage are as old as class society itself and have been an integral part of the everyday work life of wage-earners in all times and places. To the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) belongs the distinction of being the first workers&rsquo; organization in the U.S. to discuss these common practices openly, and to recognize their place in working-class struggle. Viewing direct action and sabotage in the spirit of creative nonviolence, Wobblies readily integrated these tactics into their struggle to build industrial unions.</p> 
<p>Direct action is recognized as a valuable and effective tactic by many movements around the globe and remains a cutting-edge tool for social change. Whenever communities in struggle find more conventional methods of resistance closed to them, direct action and sabotage will be employed.</p>

<p>How do we create new, nonhierarchical structures of support and mutual aid, and include all ages in the struggle for social justice? There are many books on parenting, but few on being a good community member and a good ally to parents, caregivers, and children as we collectively build a strong all-ages culture of resistance. Any group of parents will tell you how hard their struggles are and how they are left out, but no book focuses on how allies can address issues of caretakers&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s oppression. Many well-intentioned childless activists don&rsquo;t interact with young people on a regular basis and don&rsquo;t know how. <em>Don&rsquo;t Leave Your Friends Behind</em> provides them with the resources and support to get started.</p>

In this collection of essays, commentaries, and interviews, written between 2002 and 2010, Andrej Grubačić speaks about the politics of balkanization&mdash;about the trial of Slobodan Milosevic, the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, neoliberal structural adjustment, humanitarian intervention, supervised independence of Kosovo, occupation of Bosnia, and other episodes of Power which he situates in the long historical context of colonialism, conquest, and intervention. </p> 

<p>But he also tells the story of the balkanization of politics, of the Balkans seen from below. A space of bogumils&mdash;those medieval heretics who fought against Crusades and churches&mdash;and a place of anti-Ottoman resistance; a home to hajduks and klefti, pirates and rebels; a refuge of feminists and socialists, of antifascists and partisans; of new social movements of occupied and recovered factories; a place of dreamers of all sorts struggling both against provincial &ldquo;peninsularity&rdquo; as well as against occupations, foreign interventions and that process which is now, in a strange inversion of history, often described by that fashionable term, &ldquo;balkanization.&rdquo; </p> 

<p>For Grubačić, political activist and radical sociologist, Yugoslavia was never just a country&mdash;it was an idea. Like the Balkans itself, it was a project of inter-ethnic co-existence, a trans-ethnic and pluricultural space of many diverse worlds. Political ideas of inter-ethnic cooperation and mutual aid as we had known them in Yugoslavia were destroyed by the beginning of the 1990s&mdash;disappeared in the combined madness of ethno-nationalist hysteria and humanitarian imperialism. This remarkable collection chronicles political experiences of the author who is himself a Yugoslav, a man without a country; but also, as an anarchist, a man without a state. This book is an important reading for those on the Left who are struggling to understand the intertwined legacy of inter-ethnic conflict and inter-ethnic solidarity in contemporary, post-Yugoslav history.</p>"

<p> Here will be found the &ldquo;utopian essays and practical proposals&rdquo; that inspired the dissident youth of the Sixties, influencing movement theory and practice so profoundly that they have become underlying assumptions of today&rsquo;s radicalism.

<p>Industrial civilization is devouring the planet and the future. The oceans are acidifying, whole mountains have been laid to waste, and the climate is teetering into chaos. Every biome is approaching collapse. And fifty years of environmentalism hasn&rsquo;t even slowed the rate of destruction. Yet environmentalists are not considering strategies that might actually prevent the looming biocide we are facing.</p>
<p>Until Earth at Risk.</p>
<p><em>Earth at Risk: Building a Resistance Movement to Save the Planet</em> is an annual conference featuring environmental thinkers and activists who are willing to ask the hardest questions about the seriousness of our situation. The conference is convened by Derrick Jensen, acclaimed author of <em>Endgame</em>, who has argued that we need a resistance movement against civilization itself.</p>
<p>The twelve people in this volume present an impassioned critique of the dominant culture from every angle: William Catton Jr. explains ecological overshoot; Thomas Linzey gives a fiery call for community sovereignty; Jane Caputi exposes patriarchy&rsquo;s mythic dismemberment of the Goddess; Aric McBay discusses historically effective resistance strategies; and Stephanie McMillan takes down capitalism. One by one, they build an unassailable case that we need to deprive the rich of their ability to steal from the poor and the powerful of their ability to destroy the planet. These speakers offer their ideas on what can be done to build a real resistance movement, one that includes all levels of direct action&mdash;action that can actually match the scale of the problem.</p>

This meant studying previous attempts and theories, namely those of the post-1917 German-Dutch and Italian Communist Left. The original essays included here were first written between 1969 and 1972 and circulated amongst left communist and worker circles.</p>
<p>But France was not the only country where radicals sought to contextualize their political environment and analyze their own radical pasts. Over the years these three essays have been published separately in various languages and printed as books in both the United States and the UK with few changes. This third English edition is updated to take into account the contemporary political situation; half of the present volume is new material.</p>
<p>The book argues that doing away with wage-labor, class, the State, and private property is necessary, possible, and can only be achieved by a historical break, one that would certainly differ from October 1917&hellip; yet it would not be a peaceful, gradual, piecemeal evolution either. Like their historical predecessors&mdash;Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Anton Pannekoek, Amadeo Bordiga, Durruti, and Debord&mdash;the authors maintain a belief in revolution.</p>"

Getting out is like a weird dream, and the streets of the City are a muddle of sensations pooling around her. </p> 
<p>First there&rsquo;s the bustle&mdash;everybody busy with mysterious businesses&mdash;an amplifying racket of choices. Staggering out onto the late night streets of the City, Reno ends up at the infamous Istanbul Club: dim lights, Arabic music and the sensual Su&rsquo;ad dancing. Music, booze, babes and drugs: what more could a felonious girl want? </p> 
<p>She encounters Huntington, the poisonous charmer who lives above the Club&mdash;perverse and powerful in the way only the wealthy can be. Eddie, the underage bartender, is happy to chemically enhance every waking moment. Slowmotion, the sound light technician, huge and darkly mysterious, has connections to people and places that Reno didn&rsquo;t even know existed. Slowmotion&rsquo;s elegant friend, Poppy, offers mental transport to realms beyond Xanadu; in her little valise there&rsquo;s everything necessary for any trip, including the hallucinogenic &ldquo;Teeth of Idi Amin.&rdquo; </p> 
<p>The owner of the club, handsome gambler Sinclair, hires Reno to waitress. Grumbling, drinking, snarling, and swearing, Reno bangs her way through everyone else&rsquo;s complicated plans, entangling herself in a byzantine labyrinth of betrayal, revenge, general mayhem, and yes, good times.</p>"

That fact that Vanzetti, an Italian immigrant, learned to write in English while jailed for a capital crime is remarkable enough. What is even more astonishing is that he chose to use his new language skills to write creatively, inventing a parable about worker exploitation and environmental disaster that is as relevant today as it was almost one hundred years ago when this prisoner took up his pen. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Events and Victims&rdquo; allows Vanzetti a new literary and historical voice, an important document that narrates the very injustice that its author suffered and fought.

Three days later, in supposed response, Jews across Germany were beaten, imprisoned, and killed, their homes, shops, and synagogues smashed and burned&mdash;Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass.</p>
<p>Based on the historical record and told through his &ldquo;letters&rdquo; from German prisons, the novel begins in 1936, when fifteen-year-old Herschel flees Germany. Penniless and alone, he makes it to Paris where he lives hand-to-mouth, his shadow existence mixing him with the starving and the wealthy, with hustlers, radicals, and seamy sides of Paris nightlife.</p>
<p>In 1938, the French state rejects refugee status for Herschel and orders him out of the country. With nowhere to go, and now sought by the police, he slips underground in immigrant east Paris.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Nazis round up all Polish Jews in Germany&mdash;including Herschel&rsquo;s family&mdash;and dump them on the Poland border. Herschel&rsquo;s response is to shoot the German official, then wait calmly for the French police.</p>
<p>June 1940, Herschel is still in prison awaiting trial when the Nazi army nears Paris. He is evacuated south to another jail but escapes into the countryside amid the chaos of millions of French fleeing the invasion. After an incredible month alone on the road, Herschel seeks protection at a prison in the far south of France. Two weeks later the French state hands him to the Gestapo.</p>
<p>The Nazis plan a big show trial, inviting the world press to Berlin for the spectacle, to demonstrate through Herschel that Jews had provoked the war. Except that Herschel throws a last-minute wrench in the plans, bringing the Nazi propaganda machine to a grinding halt. Hitler himself postpones the trial and orders that no decision be made about Herschel&rsquo;s fate until the F&uuml;hrer personally gives an order&mdash;one way or another.</p>"

Author, musician, and native San Franciscan Mat Callahan explores the dynamic links between the Black Panthers and Sly and the Family Stone, the United Farm Workers and Santana, the Indian Occupation of Alcatraz and the San Francisco Mime Troupe, and the New Left and the counterculture.</p>
<p>Callahan&rsquo;s meticulous, impassioned arguments both expose and reframe the political and social context for the San Francisco Sound and the vibrant subcultural uprisings with which it is associated. Using dozens of original interviews, primary sources, and personal experiences, the author shows how the intense interplay of artistic and political movements put San Francisco, briefly, in the forefront of a worldwide revolutionary upsurge.</p>
<p>A must-read for any musician, historian, or person who &ldquo;was there&rdquo; (or longed to have been), <em>The Explosion of Deferred Dreams</em> is substantive and provocative, inviting us to reinvigorate our historical sense-making of an era that assumes a mythic role in the contemporary American zeitgeist.</p>"

Amid the breakneck pace of both technological advance and environmental collapse, Robert Ostertag explores how we ourselves are changing as fast as the world around us&mdash;from how we make music, to how we have sex, to what we do to survive, and who we imagine ourselves to be. And though the environmental crisis terrifies and technology overwhelms, Ostertag finds enough creativity, compassion, and humor in our evolving behavior to keep us laughing and inspired as the world we are building overtakes the world we found.</p>

<p>A true polymath who covered the wars in Central America during the 1980s, recorded dozens of music projects, and published books on startlingly eclectic subjects, Ostertag fuses his travels as a touring musician with his journalist&rsquo;s eye for detail and the long view of a historian. Wander both the physical and the intellectual world with him. Watch Buddhist monks take selfies while meditating and DJs who make millions of dollars pretend to turn knobs in front of crowds of thousands. Shiver with families huddling through the stinging Detroit winter without heat or electricity. Meet Spice Islanders who have never seen flushing toilets yet have gay hookup apps on their phones.</p>

<p>Our best writers have struggled with how to address the catastrophes of our time without looking away. Ostertag succeeds where others have failed, with the moral acuity of Susan Sontag, the technological savvy of Lewis Mumford, and the biting humor of Jonathan Swift.</p>"

George Lakey presents the core principles and proven techniques of direct education, an approach he developed for effectively teaching adults in groups. To illustrate how it works in action, Lakey includes a wealth of compelling stories from his vast experience facilitating groups in a variety of situations.</p>
<p>Direct education cuts through the pretense and needless complications that can distance learners from subject matter. It removes false expectations (for example, that kinesthetic learners will strongly benefit from slide presentations) and false assumptions (for example, that a group is simply the sum of the individuals). This approach focuses the encounter between teacher and group; it replaces scattered attention&mdash;of a teacher preoccupied with curriculum and participants preoccupied with distractions&mdash;with gathered attention.</p>
<p>Unlike in other books on group facilitation, the author emphasizes critical issues related to diversity, as well as authenticity and emotions. Step by step, this groundbreaking book describes how to design effective learning experiences and shows what it takes to facilitate them. Ultimately, it brings all the elements of the author&rsquo;s direct education approach together.</p>
<p><em>Facilitating Group Learning</em> also contains material on sustaining the educator, addresses working with social movements, and includes the Training for Change toolkit of group learning techniques.</p>"

It&#8217;s a furious and sardonic account of dark times when pop music raised a dissenting fist against Thatcher&#8217;s fascist groove thing and made a glorious, boredom-smashing noise.

Released in 1990, it reached its fifth edition by 1997, with the legendary German <em>Konkret</em> journal concluding that &ldquo;the movement had produced its own classic.&rdquo; The author, writing under the pseudonym of Geronimo, has been an autonomous activist since the movement burst onto the scene in 1980&ndash;81. In this book, he traces its origins in the Italian Autonomia project and the German social movements of the 1970s, before describing the battles for squats, &ldquo;free spaces,&rdquo; and alternative forms of living that defined the first decade of the autonomous movement. Tactics of the &ldquo;Autonome&rdquo; were militant, including the construction of barricades or throwing molotov cocktails at the police. Because of their outfit (heavy black clothing, ski masks, helmets), the Autonome were dubbed the &ldquo;Black Bloc&rdquo; by the German media, and their tactics have been successfully adopted and employed at anticapitalist protests worldwide. </p>
<p><em>Fire and Flames</em> is no detached academic study, but a passionate, hands-on, and engaging account of the beginnings of one of Europe&rsquo;s most intriguing protest movements of the last thirty years. An introduction by George Katsiaficas, author of <em>The Subversion of Politics</em>, and an afterword by Gabriel Kuhn, a long-time autonomous activist and author, add historical context and an update on the current state of the Autonomen.</p>"

<p>The title story, &ldquo;Fire.&rdquo;&mdash;written especially for this volume&mdash;is a harrowing postapocalyptic adventure in a world threatened by global conflagration.

In defending their autonomy, federations in the International became aware of what separated them from the social democratic movement that relied on the establishment of national labor parties and the conquest of political power. This can be seen as a decisive moment in the history of political ideas: the split between centralist party politics and the federalist grassroots movement. The separate movements in the International&mdash;which would later develop into social democracy, communism, and anarchism&mdash;found their greatest advocates in Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx. However, the significance of this alleged clash of titans is largely a modern invention. It was not the rivalry between two arch-enemies or a personal vendetta based on mutual resentment that made the conflict between Bakunin and Marx so important but rather that it heralded the first socialist schism between parliamentary party politics aiming to conquer political power and social-revolutionary concepts.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing exclusively on what Marx and Bakunin said, many other contributions to this debate are examined, making this the first reconstruction of a dispute that gripped the entire organization. This book also provides the first detailed account of the International&rsquo;s Congress of The Hague (September, 1872); including the background, the sequence of events, and international reaction. The book sets new standards when it comes to source material, taking into account documents from numerous archives and libraries that have previously gone unnoticed or were completely unknown.</p>"

<p>In this collection of essays, written between the 1950s and 1980s and published here for the first time in English, Gu&eacute;rin not only provides a critique of the socialist and communist parties of his day, he analyzes some of the most fundamental and pressing questions with which all radicals must engage. He does this by revisiting and attempting to draw lessons from the history of the revolutionary movement from the French Revolution, through the conflicts between anarchists and Marxists in the International Workingmen&rsquo;s Association and the Russian and Spanish revolutions, to the social revolution of 1968. These are not just abstract theoretical reflections, but are informed by the experiences of a lifetime of revolutionary commitments and by his constant willingness to challenge orthodoxies of all kinds: &ldquo;Far from allowing ourselves to sink into doubt, inaction, and despair, the time has come for the left to begin again from zero, to rethink its problems from their very foundations. The failure of both reformism and Stalinism imposes on us the urgent duty to find a way of reconciling (proletarian) democracy with socialism, freedom with Revolution.&rdquo;</p>"

<p>Focusing far beyond one particular era, organization, leader, or form of cooperation, <em>For All the People</em> documents the multigenerational struggle of the American working people for social justice. While the economic system was in its formative years, generation after generation of American working people challenged it by organizing visionary social movements aimed at liberating themselves from what they called wage slavery. Workers substituted a system based on cooperative work and constructed parallel institutions that would supersede the institutions of the wage system. </p>
<p>With an expansive sweep and breathtaking detail, this scholarly yet eminently readable chronicle follows the American worker from the colonial workshop to the modern mass-assembly line, from the family farm to the corporate hierarchy, ultimately painting a vivid panorama of those who built the United States and those who will shape its future.</p>

In 2012, the accreditor sanctioned City College of San Francisco, one of the biggest and best community colleges in the country, and a year later proposed terminating its accreditation, leading to a state takeover. <em>Free City!</em> follows the multipronged strategies of the campaign and the diverse characters that carried them out. Teachers, students, labor unions, community groups, public officials, and concerned individuals saved a treasured public institution as San Francisco&rsquo;s working-class communities of color battled the gentrification that was forcing them out of the city. And they pushed back against the national &ldquo;reform&rdquo; agenda of corporate workforce training that drives students towards debt and sidelines lifelong learning and community service programs. Combining analysis with narrative, <em>Free City!</em> offers a case study in the power of positive vision and solution-oriented organizing and a reflection on what education can and should be.</p>"

It would extend over years, decades probably, but from Day One it would begin to do away with wage-labour, profit, productivity, private property, classes, States, masculine domination, and more. There would be no &ldquo;transition period&rdquo; in the Marxist sense, no period when the &ldquo;associated producers&rdquo; continue furthering economic growth to create the industrial foundations of a new world. Communisation means a creative insurrection that would bring about communism, not its preconditions.</p>
<p>Thus stated, it sounds simple enough. The questions are what, how, and by whom. That is what this book is about.</p>
<p>Communisation is not the be-all and end-all that solves everything and proves wrong all past critical theory. The concept was born out of a specific period, and we can fully understand it by going back to how people personally and collectively experienced the crises of the 1960s and &rsquo;70s. The notion is now developing in the maelstrom of a new crisis, deeper than the Depression of the 1930s, among other reasons because of its ecological dimension, a crisis that has the scope and magnitude of a crisis of civilisation.</p>
<p>This is not a book that glorifies existing struggles as if their present accumulation were enough to result in revolution. Radical theory is meaningful if it addresses the question: How can proletarian resistance to exploitation and dispossession achieve more than aggravate the crisis? How can it reshape the world?</p>"

<p>The first section of the <em>Reader</em> collects reminiscences and analyses of the 1960s.

In the last section Lynd explores what nonviolence, resistance to empire as a way of life, and working class self-activity might mean in the twenty-first century. Together, they provide a sweeping overview of the life, and work&mdash;to date&mdash;of Staughton Lynd. </p>

<p>Both a definitive introduction and further exploration, it is bound to educate, enlighten, and inspire those new to his work and those who have been following it for decades.

He became a member of the Black Panther Party while in Angola State Penitentiary, successfully organizing prisoners to improve conditions. In return, prison authorities beat him, starved him, and gave him life without parole after framing him for a second crime. He was thrown into solitary confinement, where he remained in a six-by-nine-foot cell for 29 years as one of the Angola 3. In 2001, the state grudgingly acknowledged his innocence and set him free. This is his story.</p>
<p>It begins at the beginning: born black, born poor, born in Louisiana in 1942, King journeyed to Chicago as a hobo at the age of 15. He married and had a child, and briefly pursued a semi-pro boxing career to help provide for his family. Just a teenager when he entered the Louisiana penal system for the first time, King tells of his attempts to break out of this system, and his persistent pursuit of justice where there is none.</p>
<p>Yet this remains a story of inspiration and courage, and the triumph of the human spirit. The conditions in Angola almost defy description, yet King never gave up his humanity, or the work towards justice for all prisoners that he continues to do today. <em>From the Bottom of the Heap</em>, so simply and humbly told, strips bare the economic and social injustices inherent in our society, while continuing to be a powerful literary testimony to our own strength and capacity to overcome. The paperback edition includes additional writings from Robert King and an update on the case of the Angola 3.</p>"

This book is a call to action against the most persistent and pestilent disease of our time. Translated into over twenty different languages, the book offers a call to action that transcends local contexts and speaks to the violent global conditions of our neoliberal age.</p>
<p><em>Fuck Neoliberalism: Translating Resistance</em> is a worldwide middle finger to the all-encompassing ideology of our era. The original essay sparked controversy in the academy when it was first released and has since spread around the world as enthusiastic rebels translated it into their own languages. This book brings those translations together, accompanied by short essays from each translator explaining why they translated the text and describing struggles against neoliberalism in their regions.</p>
<p>With translations into languages from across the globe, including Mandarin, German, Indonesian, Spanish, Hindi, Italian, Korean, and many more, this book highlights the international nature of resistance to the totalitarian ideology of neoliberalism. Featuring a cover produced by renowned artist Ed Repka (a.k.a. the King of Thrash Metal Art), this internationalized, heavy-metal rant against the all-powerful ideology highlights a chink in its armor. When people across the world find a way to communicate a shared message and stand together, resistance can be both beautiful and inspiring.</p>"

Born in Scotland in 1868 to Irish immigrant parents, Connolly spent most of his adult life organizing for labor unions and socialist organizations in Ireland, Scotland, and the United States. Despite attending school for only a few years, Connolly became a leading socialist writer and theoretician, founding and editing newspapers including <em>The Socialist</em> (Scotland), <em>The Harp</em> (United States), and <em>The Workers&rsquo; Republic</em>  (Ireland). As a labor organizer, Connolly stressed the importance of direct action, broad working-class unity, and a commitment to ending labor&rsquo;s exploitation. As a socialist agitator, Connolly saw economic and political independence as inextricably intertwined. This pamphlet, the first graphic treatment of Connolly&rsquo;s life, is issued on the centenary of the Easter Rising.</p>"

Visionary plans for how to slash emissions and make society better at the same time abound, including various Green New Deals. But how can we make the changes that are so urgently needed?</p>
<p><em>Future on Fire</em> argues that a just transition from fossil fuels and other drivers of climate change will not be delivered by businesspeople or politicians that support the status quo. Nor will electing green left leaders be enough to overcome the opposition of capitalists and state bureaucrats. Only the power of disruptive mass social movements has the potential to force governments to make the changes we need, so supporters of climate justice should commit to building them. Confronting the question “what if heating above 2 degrees becomes unavoidable?” and refusing to despair, David Camfield argues that even a ravaged planet is worth fighting for—and that ultimately the only solution to the ecological crisis created by capitalism is a transition to ecosocialism.</p>"

Waves of enraged citizens took to the streets to streets in Minneapolis to decry the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police. </b>Battles broke out night after night, with a pandemic weary populace fighting the police and eventually burning down the Third Precinct. The revolt soon spread to cities large and small across the country where protesters set police cars on fire, looted luxury shopping districts and forced the president into hiding in a bunker beneath the White House. As the initial crest receded, localized rebellions continued to erupt throughout the summer and into the fall in Atlanta, Chicago, Kenosha, Louisville, Philadelphia, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Written during the riots, <em>The George Floyd Uprising </em>is a compendium of the most radical writing to come out of that long, hot summer. These incendiary dispatches—from those on the frontlines of the struggle—examines the revolt and the obstacles it confronted. It paints a picture of abolition in practice, discusses how the presence of weapons in the uprising and the threat of armed struggle play out in an American context, and shows how the state responds to and pacifies rebellions. <em>The George Floyd Uprising</em> poses new social, tactical, and strategic plans for those actively seeking to expand and intensify revolts of the future. This practical, inspiring collection is essential reading for all those hard at work toppling the state and creating a new revolutionary tradition.</p>"

As the young created new styles in music, fashion, and culture, pulp fiction shadowed their every move, hyping and exploiting their behaviour, dress, and language for mass consumption and cheap thrills. From the juvenile delinquent gangs of the early 1950s through the beats and hippies, on to bikers, skinheads, and punks, pulp fiction left no trend untouched. With their lurid covers and wild, action-packed plots, these books reveal as much about society&rsquo;s deepest desires and fears as they do about the subcultures themselves.</p>

<p><em>Girl Gangs</em> features approximately 400 full-color covers, many of them never reprinted before. With 70 in-depth author interviews, illustrated biographies, and previously unpublished articles from more than 20 popular culture critics and scholars from the US, UK, and Australia, the book goes behind the scenes to look at the authors and publishers, how they worked, where they drew their inspiration and&mdash;often overlooked&mdash;the actual words they wrote. Books by well-known authors such as Harlan Ellison and Lawrence Block are discussed alongside neglected obscurities and former bestsellers ripe for rediscovery. It is a must read for anyone interested in pulp fiction, lost literary history, retro and subcultural style, and the history of postwar youth culture.</p>

Robinson,,,,,,,,,,,,,17.95,"<p><strong>Following up on his earlier best-seller, <em>The Global Police State</em>, this exciting new study by critically-acclaimed scholar and activist William I. Robinson offers a big-picture contribution to understanding contemporary global society in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.</strong> It puts forth an original and cutting-edge exposé of the radical transformation of global capitalism now underway, driven by new digital technologies and turbo-charged by the pandemic. It provides shocking data and analysis on the concentration of power and control in the hands of corporate conglomerates, tech giants, mega-banks, and the military-industrial complex. The book documents the extent of unprecedented global inequalities as the mass of humanity faces violent dispossession and uncertain survival. Enabled by digital applications, the ruling groups, unless they are pushed to change course by mass pressure from below, will turn to ratcheting up the global police state to contain the global revolt. If the book issues a dire warning against the emergence of a dystopic digitalized dictatorship it also finds great hope and inspiration in the burgeoning social movements of the poor and the dispossessed as humanity descends into global civil war. While deeply analytical and theoretically sophisticated, the study is written in such a style that it is eminently accessible to a wider public beyond the academy. While the work will satisfy scholars, it is destined to become a companion text to those struggling on the frontlines for global social justice and a more hopeful future.</p>"

With discussions of more than fifty countries, Katsiaficas articulates an understanding that is neither bounded by national and continental divides nor focused on &ldquo;Great Men and Women.&rdquo; Millions of people went into the streets, and their aspirations were remarkably similar. From the Prague revolt against Soviet communism to the French May uprising, the Vietnam Tet offensive, African anticolonial insurgencies, the civil rights movement, and campus eruptions in Latin America, Yugoslavia, the United States, and beyond, this book portrays the movements of the 1960s as intuitively tied together.</p>
<p>Student movements challenged authorities in almost every country, giving the insurgency a global character, and contemporary feminist, Latino, and gay liberation movements all came to life. A focus on the French general strike of May 1968 and the U.S. movement&rsquo;s high point in 1970&mdash;from the May campus strike to the revolt in the military, workers&rsquo; wildcat strikes, the national women&rsquo;s strike, the Chicano Moratorium, and the Black Panther Party&rsquo;s Revolutionary Peoples&rsquo; Constitutional Convention in September&mdash;reveals the revolutionary aspirations of the insurgencies in the core of the world system. Despite the apparent failure of the movements of 1968, their profound influence on politics, culture, and social movements continues to be felt today. As globally synchronized uprisings occur with increasing frequency in the twenty-first century, the lessons of 1968 provide useful insights for future struggles.</p>"

It argues that&mdash;far from having ended&mdash;the crisis has ushered in a whole period of worldwide economic and political turbulence. In developing an account of the crisis as rooted in fundamental features of capitalism, <em>Global Slump</em> challenges the view that its source lies in financial deregulation.</p>
<p>The book locates the recent meltdown in the intense economic restructuring that marked the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s. Through this lens, it highlights the emergence of new patterns of world inequality and new centers of accumulation, particularly in East Asia, and the profound economic instabilities these produced. <em>Global Slump</em> offers an original account of the &ldquo;financialization&rdquo; of the world economy during this period, and explores the intricate connections between international financial markets and new forms of debt and dispossession, particularly in the Global South.</p>
<p>Analyzing the massive intervention of the world&rsquo;s central banks to stave off another Great Depression, <em>Global Slump</em> shows that, while averting a complete meltdown, this intervention also laid the basis for recurring crises for poor and working class people: job loss, increased poverty and inequality, and deep cuts to social programs. The book takes a global view of these processes, exposing the damage inflicted on countries in the Global South, as well as the intensification of racism and attacks on migrant workers. At the same time, <em>Global Slump</em> also traces new patterns of social and political resistance&mdash;from housing activism and education struggles, to mass strikes and protests in Martinique, Guadeloupe, France and Puerto Rico&mdash;as indicators of the potential for building anti-capitalist opposition to the damage that neoliberal capitalism is inflicting on the lives of millions.</p>"

The selections in the book appeared in various formats from the late nineteenth century through the early twenty-first, and their authors were often active in the anarchist, Marxist, or radical leftist movements of their day. Derived from printed pamphlets, periodicals, and newspaper pieces that were mass-produced and widely distributed, these texts serve as freethinking propaganda in a media war against morbid authoritarian doctrines.</p>
<p>With both a sophisticated analysis of inconsistencies in deistic beliefs and a biting satirical edge, <em>Godless</em> gives ammunition to those fighting fundamentalist bigotry&mdash;and more than a few reasons to abandon Christianity.</p>
<p>Readers previously familiar with the authors&rsquo; political polemics will be rewarded in contemplating another side of their remarkable literary output. Contributors include Emma Goldman, Ambrose Bierce, Chaz Bufe, E. Haldeman-Julius, Earl Lee, G. Richard Bozarth, Johann Most, Joseph McCabe, Matilda Gage, Pamela Sutter, S.C.

<p>Despite the mainstream press declarations that &ldquo;punk died with Sid Vicious&rdquo; or that &ldquo;punk was reborn with Nirvana,&rdquo; author Hurchalla followed the DIY spirit of punk underground, where it not only survived but thrived nationally as a self-sustaining grassroots movement rooted in seedy clubs, rented fire halls, Xeroxed zines, and indie record shops. </p>
<p>Rather than dwell solely on well-documented scenes from Los Angeles, New York, and Washington, DC, Hurchalla delves deep into the counterculture, rooting out stories from Chicago, Philadelphia, Austin, Cincinnati, Miami, and elsewhere. The author seamlessly mixes his personal experiences with the oral history of dozens of band members, promoters, artists, zinesters, and scenesters. Some of the countless bands covered include Articles of Faith, Big Boys, Necros, H&uuml;sker D&uuml;, Bad Brains, Government Issue, and Minutemen, as well as many of the essential zines of the time such as <em>Big Takeover</em>, <em>Maximum RocknRoll</em>, <em>Flipside</em>, and <em>Forced Exposure</em>.</p>
<p><em>Going Underground</em> features over a hundred unique photos from Marie Kanger-Born of Chicago, Dixon Coulbourn of Austin, Brian Trudell of LA, Malcolm Riviera of DC, Justina Davies of New York, Ed Arnaud of Arizona, and many others, along with flyers from across the nation.</p>"

In it he presents a people&rsquo;s history of the world-shaking events of the Revolution and shows the key role the working men and women of the towns and countryside played in it. Without the constant pressure of popular organisations and activity, the politicians would never have created a Republic, nor been able to survive the counterrevolutionary forces internally or externally.</p>



<p>Focusing on such mass movements&mdash;and especially the peasant majority&mdash;rather than on the few great men beloved of bourgeois accounts, this is a groundbreaking account of the period and a seminal work of &ldquo;history from below.&rdquo; Later research may have corrected some factual details and opened new avenues of scholarship, but Kropotkin&rsquo;s text remains an exemplar of anarchist history-writing, challenging both bourgeois republican and Marxist interpretations of the Revolution.</p>



<p>Yet it is more than a history: Kropotkin uses the experience of the French Revolution to aid us in our current struggles and to learn its lessons in order to ensure the success of future revolutions. This book raises issues which have resurfaced time and again, as well as offering solutions based on the self-activity of the masses, the new, decentralised, directly democratic social organisations they forged during the Revolution, and the need to transform a political revolt into a social revolution which seeks to secure the well-being of all by transforming the economy from the start.</p>"

These two workers&rsquo; rebellions quickly drew national attention to an area known principally for its &ldquo;black gold,&rdquo; the coal that was vital for U.S. factories, power plants, and warships of that age.</p>
<p>In 1912, miners struck against the harsh conditions in the work camps of Paint and Cabin Creeks and coal operators responded with force. The ensuing battles caused the West Virginia governor to declare martial law, prompting Samuel Gompers to dub the state &ldquo;Russianized West Virginia [where] the people can be naught but serfs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There was little improvement in working conditions by 1921, when another army&mdash;thousands of union miners&mdash;went up against similar numbers of state police, local deputies, and paid company guards. The weeklong Battle of Blair Mountain ended only after President Warren Harding sent 2,000 U.S. troops and a small unit of bombers to pacify the region</p>
<p><em>Gun Thugs, Rednecks, and Radicals</em> tells the story of these union battles as seen by the leaders, rank-and-file participants, and the journalists who came to West Virginia to cover them for papers including <em>The Nation</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. </p>
<p>Union leaders like Gompers, Frank Keeney, Fred Mooney, Bill Blizzard, and Mother Jones discuss the lives and struggles of the miners for their union. The book also contains articles, speeches, and personal testimony heard by two U.S. Senate committees sent to investigate West Virginia&rsquo;s labor problems. In this testimony, miners and their family members describe life and work in the coal camps, telling why they participated in these violent episodes in West Virginia history. </p>
<p>Special attention is given to the role of Huntington&rsquo;s own radical newspaper, <em>The Socialist and Labor Star</em>, a forgotten monument in the history of American heresy and radicalism. </p>"

Clark,,,,,,,,,21.95,"<p>This is the first and best intellectual biography of Guy Debord, prime mover of the Situationist International (1957&ndash;1972) and author of <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>, perhaps the seminal book of the May 1968 uprising in France. Anselm Jappe offers a powerful corrective to the continual attempts to incorporate Debord&rsquo;s theoretical work into &ldquo;French theory.&rdquo; Jappe&rsquo;s focus, to the contrary, is on Debord&rsquo;s debt to the Hegelian-Marxist tradition, to Karl Korsch and Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and more generally to left-Marxist currents of council communism. His close reading of Debord&rsquo;s magnum opus supplies a superb gloss that has never been rivaled despite the great flood of writing on the Situationists in recent decades.</p>
<p>At the same time, Debord is placed squarely in context among the Letterist and Situationist anti-artists who, in the aftermath of World War II, sought to criticize and transcend the legacy of Dada and Surrealism. Jappe&rsquo;s book offers a lively account of the Situationists&rsquo; theory and practice as this &ldquo;last avant-garde&rdquo; made its way from radical bohemianism to revolutionary theory and action. </p>

An interstellar adventure grounded in the hard science of accurate physics and biology, <em>Gypsy</em> soars far beyond the heliosphere of conventional science fiction. Jettisoning the easy warp-drives of fantasy and space opera, Scholz chronicles with chilling realism the epic voyage of a team of far-seeing scientists, who crowdsource a secret starship and abandon the doomed Earth for the Alpha Centauri system, our nearest stellar neighbor and last desperate chance.

Unapologetic and unabashed, <em>(H)afrocentric</em> introduces us to strong yet vulnerable students of color, as well as an aesthetic that connects current Black pop culture to an organic reappropriation of hip hop fashion circa the early 90s.</p>

Naima Pepper recruits a group of disgruntled undergrads of color to combat the onslaught by creating and launching the first and only anti-gentrification social networking site, mydiaspora.com. The motley crew is poised to fight back against expensive avocado toast, muted Prius cars, exorbitant rent, and cultural appropriation. </p>
<p>Whether Naima and the gang are transforming social media, leading protests, fighting rent hikes, or working as &ldquo;Racial Translators,&rdquo; the students at Ronald Reagan University take movements to a new level by combining their tech-savvy, Black Millennial sensibilities with their individual backgrounds, goals, and aspirations.</p>"

They came to enroll in college programs and college preparatory courses&mdash;and to escape, if only temporarily, the daily and ubiquitous indignities suffered under the Jim Crow racial hierarchy. They excelled in their studies and became accomplished in their professional fields. Many went on to both ignite and help lead the explosive civil rights movement. Very few people know their stories&mdash;until now.</p>
<p><em>Haste to Rise</em> is a book about the incredible resilience and breathtaking accomplishments of those students. It was written to unearth, contextualize, and share their stories and important lessons with this generation. Along the way we are introduced to dozens of these Jim Crow&ndash;era students, including the first African American to win a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Belford Lawson, the lead attorney in <em>New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co.</em> (1938), a landmark court battle that safeguarded the right to picket. We also meet one of Lawson&rsquo;s contemporaries, Percival L. Prattis, a pioneering journalist and influential newspaper executive. In 1947, he became the first African American news correspondent admitted to the U.S. House and Senate press galleries. There is also an in-depth look into the life and work of the institute&rsquo;s founder, Woodbridge Nathan Ferris, a racial justice pioneer who created educational opportunities for women, international students, and African Americans.</p>
<p><em>Haste to Rise</em> is a challenge to others to look beyond a university&rsquo;s official history and seek a more complete knowledge of its past. This is American history done right!</p>"

Carter USM is a live wire who lives on the edge and tries not to think too much; Mango can&rsquo;t stop thinking, has made money but is weighed down by family tragedy; Harry is a beer-lover and dreamer; Balti is his drinking partner, out of work and hoping for a fresh start; while Will is the quiet romantic, a voice of reason as the lives of the others become increasingly chaotic and veer towards disaster.</p>
<p><em>Headhunters</em> is also a story of London. The novel is rooted in its streets, workplaces, pubs and music, but a parallel society exists, where the planet&rsquo;s wealthy are able to buy and sell whatever they like. This is a world from which the Londoners of this novel are excluded, resentment too often directed against their own kind. The Unity is the boys&rsquo; local pub and it is here that they form a tongue-in-cheek Sex Division to celebrate a new year. Based on the idea of a football league, the most Woman can offer Man is four points&mdash;unless she leaves her handbag unattended.</p>
<p>Carter is the Unstoppable Sex Machine and soon leads the table, while Mango breaks the rules and buys success. Harry and Balti are overweight and hard up, know they have little to offer apart from their personalities, turn to cold lager and hot curries instead of sex. Will falls in loves and retires. Recognition of the affinities between the sexes soon becomes clear. Background is more important than gender.</p>
<p><em>Headhunters</em> mixes humor and longing as the real feelings of these men break through, moving beyond expectations. A missing brother, prophetic visions, genuine romance and a tit-for-tat confrontation draw the characters out into the open&mdash;revealing the individuals behind the words and their craving for respect. Events run out of control, but several happy endings seem possible.</p>"

<p>&ldquo;<em>A History of Pan-African Revolt</em> is one of those rare books that continues to strike a chord of urgency, even half a century after it was first published. Time and time again, its lessons have proven to be valuable and relevant for understanding liberation movements in Africa and the diaspora. Each generation who has had the opportunity to read this small book finds new insights, new lessons, new visions for their own age&hellip;. No piece of literature can substitute for a crystal ball, and only religious fundamentalists believe that a book can provide comprehensive answers to all questions. But if nothing else, <em>A History of Pan-African Revolt</em> leaves us with two incontrovertible facts. First, as long as black people are denied freedom, humanity and a decent standard of living, they will continue to revolt. Second, unless these revolts involve the ordinary masses and take place on their own terms, they have no hope of succeeding.&rdquo; &mdash;Robin D.G. Kelley, from the Introduction</p>

Written by fellow worker and musician Mike Stout, the book is an insider&rsquo;s portrait of the union at the U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Homestead Works, specifically the workers, activists, and insurgents that made up the radically democratic Rank and File Caucus from 1977 to 1987. Developing its own &ldquo;inside-outside&rdquo; approach to unionism, the Rank and File Caucus drastically expanded their sphere of influence so that, in addition to fighting for their own rights as workers, they fought to prevent the closures of other steel plants, opposed U.S. imperialism in Central America, fought for civil rights, and built strategic coalitions with local environmental groups.</p>
<p>Mike Stout skillfully chronicles his experience in the takeover and restructuring of the union&rsquo;s grievance procedure at Homestead by regular workers and put at the service of its thousands of members. Stout writes with raw honesty and pulls no punches when recounting the many foibles and setbacks he experienced along the way. The Rank and File Caucus was a profound experiment in democracy that was aided by the <em>1397 Rank and File</em> newspaper&mdash;an ultimate expression of truth, democracy, and free speech that guaranteed every union member a valuable voice.</p>

<p>Starting with the construction site and the physical building of houses, the book slowly builds and links more and more issues together: from gentrification and city politics to gender roles and identity politics, from subcontracting and speculation to union contracts and negotiation, from individual belief, suffering, and resistance to structural division, necessity, and instability. What starts as a look at housing broadens into a critique of capitalism as a whole. The text is accompanied by clean black-and-white illustrations that are mocking, beautiful, and bleak.</p>"

<p>As a result of I.W.W. efforts to keep up with the times, however, recent versions of the songbook have omitted most of the old-time favorites, especially the raucous lyrics of the free-spirited hoboes who made up such a large portion of the union&rsquo;s membership in its heyday.

Exploring a wide range of political traditions&mdash;including Marxism, anarchism, anti-imperialism, postmodernism, feminism, critical race theory, and environmentalism&mdash;Cynthia Kaufman acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of political movements and the ideologies inspired by or generated through them. Kaufman incorporates elements of her own activist experiences and presents a coherent analysis without pretending to offer &ldquo;the final word&rdquo; on complex issues. Instead, she helps orient a critical understanding of the social world and a glimpse of the excitement and rewards of serious intellectual engagement with political ideas.</p>
<p>Fully updated to confront pressing issues of today&mdash;from mass incarceration to climate change, from the war on terror to the national security state, from rising inequality to a global shortage of care, <em>Ideas for Action</em> also examines the work of diverse thinkers such as Adam Smith, Paulo Freire, Grace Lee Boggs, and Stuart Hall. Kaufman&rsquo;s insights break the chains of cynicism and lay a foundation for more effective organizing.</p>"

It is embedded in our evolution, encoded in our DNA, which is to say, essential to our survival. Academics in a variety of disciplines have considered this idea to devise explanations that Richard Manning, a lifelong journalist, finds hollow, arcane, incomplete, ivory-towered, and just plain wrong. He approaches the question from a wholly different angle, using his own guitar and banjo as instruments of discovery. In the process, he finds himself dancing in celebration of music rough and rowdy.</p>
<p>American roots music is not a product of an elite leisure class, as some academics contend, but of explosive creativity among slaves, hillbillies, field hands, drunks, slackers, and hucksters. Yet these people&mdash;poor, working people&mdash;built the foundations of jazz, gospel, blues, bluegrass, rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll, and country music, an unparalleled burst of invention. This is the counterfactual to the academics&rsquo; story. This is what tells us music is essential, but by pulling this thread, Manning takes us down a long, strange path, following music to deeper understandings of racism, slavery, inequality, meditation, addiction, the science of our brains, and ultimately to an enticing glimpse of pure religion.</p>
<p>Use this book to follow where his guitar leads. Ultimately it sings the American body, electric.</p>"

Clark,,,,,,,,,,,,,24.95,"<p><em>The Impossible Community</em> confronts a critical moment when social and ecological catastrophes loom, the Left seems unable to articulate a response, and the Right controls public debates. This book offers a fresh and highly readable reformulation of anarchist social and political theory to develop a communitarian anarchist solution.</p>

<p>In this stunningly original work, John P. Clark, author, lifelong activist, and one of the most fascinating anarchist luminaries of our time, skillfully argues that a free and just social order requires a radical transformation of the modes of domination exercised through social ideology, the social imaginary, the social ethos, and social institutional structures. Communitarian anarchism unites a universalist concern for social and ecological justice while recognizing the integrity and individuality of the person. <em>The Impossible Community</em> is a renewed examination of the anarchist principles of mutual aid and voluntary cooperation and provides convincingly lucid examples in various contexts, from the rebuilding of New Orleans after Katrina to social movements in South Asia.</p>

<p>Ambitious in scope and compelling in its strength and imagination, <em>The Impossible Community</em> offers readers an accessible theoretical framework along with concrete case studies to show how contemporary anarchist practice continues a long tradition of successfully synthesizing personal and communal liberation. This provocatively innovative work will appeal not only to students of anarchism and political theory but also to activists and anyone interested in making the world a better place.</p>"

<p>While many around the globe are increasingly wondering if another world is indeed possible, few are mapping out potential avenues &ndash; and flagging wrong turns &ndash; en route to a post-capitalist future. In this groundbreaking analysis of the meltdown, renowned radical political economists Albo, Gindin, and Panitch lay bare the roots of the crisis, which they locate in the dynamic expansion of capital on a global scale over the last quarter century&mdash;and in the inner logic of capitalism itself. </p>
<p>With an unparalleled understanding of the inner workings of capitalism, the authors of <em>In and Out of Crisis</em> provocatively challenge the call by much of the Left for a return to a largely mythical Golden Age of economic regulation as a check on finance capital unbound. They deftly illuminate how the era of neoliberal free markets has been, in practice, undergirded by state intervention on a massive scale. With clarity and erudition, they argue persuasively that given the current balance of social forces&mdash;as bank bailouts around the globe make evident&mdash;regulation is not a means of fundamentally reordering power in society, but rather a way of preserving markets. </p>
<p>Contrary to those who believe US hegemony is on the wane, Albo, Gindin, and Panitch contend that the meltdown has, in fact, reinforced the centrality of the American state as the dominant force within global capitalism, while simultaneously increasing the difficulties entailed in managing its imperial role.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors argue that it&rsquo;s time to start thinking about genuinely transformative alternatives to capitalism&mdash;and how to build the collective capacity to get us there. We should be thinking bigger and preparing to go further. <em>In and Out of Crisis</em> stands to be the enduring critique of the crisis and an indispensable springboard for a renewed Left.</p>"

In this collection of essays, George Caffentzis argues that the same is true for the annals of twenty-first-century capitalism. Information technology, immaterial production, financialization, and globalization have been trumpeted as inaugurating a new phase of capitalism that puts it beyond its violent origins. Instead of being a period of major social and economic novelty, however, the course of recent decades has been a return to the fire and blood of struggles at the advent of capitalism.</p>
<p>Emphasizing class struggles that have proliferated across the social body of global capitalism, Caffentzis shows how a wide range of conflicts and antagonisms in the labor-capital relation express themselves within and against the work process. These struggles are so central to the dynamic of the system that even the most sophisticated machines cannot liberate capitalism from class struggle and the need for labor. Themes of war and crisis permeate the text and are given singular emphasis, documenting the peculiar way in which capital perpetuates violence and proliferates misery on a world scale. This collection draws upon a careful rereading of Marx&rsquo;s thought in order to elucidate political concerns of the day. Originally written to contribute to the debates of the anticapitalist movement over the last thirty years, this book makes Caffentzis&rsquo;s writings readily available as tools for the struggle in this period of transition to a common future.</p>"

The lectures focus on what anticapitalist revolution can mean today&mdash;after the historic failure of the idea that the conquest of state power was the key to radical change&mdash;and offer a brilliant and engaging introduction to the central themes of Holloway&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>The lectures take as their central challenge the idea that &ldquo;We Are the Crisis of Capital and Proud of It.&rdquo; This runs counter to many leftist assumptions that the capitalists are to blame for the crisis, or that crisis is simply the expression of the bankruptcy of the system. The only way to see crisis as the possible threshold to a better world is to understand the failure of capitalism as the face of the push of our creative force. This poses a theoretical challenge. The first lecture focuses on the meaning of &ldquo;We,&rdquo; the second on the understanding of capital as a system of social cohesion that systematically frustrates our creative force, and the third on the proposal that we are the crisis of this system of cohesion. </p>
<p>&ldquo;His Marxism is premised on another form of logic, one that affirms movement, instability, and struggle. This is a movement of thought that affirms the richness of life, particularity (non-identity) and &lsquo;walking in the opposite direction&rsquo;; walking, that is, away from exploitation, domination, and classification. Without contradictory thinking in, against, and beyond the capitalist society, capital once again becomes a reified object, a thing, and not a social relation that signifies transformation of a useful and creative activity (doing) into (abstract) labor. Only open dialectics, a right kind of thinking for the wrong kind of world, non-unitary thinking without guarantees, is able to assist us in our contradictory struggle for a world free of contradiction.&rdquo;&mdash;Andrej Grubačić, from his Preface</p>"

<p>Unmistakably, this is the voice of Colonel Pyat, addict, inventor, and bizarre Everyman for the twentieth century. In <em>Jerusalem Commands</em>, the third of the Pyat quartet, our hero schemes and fantasises his way from New York to Hollywood, from Cairo to Marrakech, from cult success to the utter limits of sexual degradation, leaving a trail of mechanical and human wreckage in his wake as he crashes towards an inevitable appointment with the worst nightmare this century has to offer.</p>
<p>It is Michael Moorcock&rsquo;s extraordinary achievement to convert the life of Maxim Pyatnitski into epic and often hilariously comic adventure. Sustained by his dreams and profligate inventions, his determination to turn his back on the realities of his own origins, Pyat runs from crisis to crisis, every ruse a further link in a vast chain of deceit, suppression, betrayal.

They tell us why the organization&rsquo;s core principle&mdash;the power of solidarity between unions, community groups, and immigrant, student, and faith organizations&mdash;continues to drive its victories at the local, national, and international levels. They tell us how the belief in solidarity leads not only to short-term alliances, but also to transformed relationships and permanent coalitions. They tell us how it has led&mdash;and will lead&mdash;to concrete victories for social and economic justice.</p>

Until the night they realize that they&rsquo;ve all survived rape&mdash;and that not one of their assailants has suffered a single consequence. Enough is enough. The Knitting Circle becomes the Knitting Circle Rapist Annihilation Squad. They declare open season on rapists, with no licenses and no bag limits. With needles as their weapons, the revolution begins.</p>
<p>A cop is stabbed through a doughnut hole and into his heart. A country-western singer is found with knitting needles jammed into both ears and his no-means-yes hit song playing. A pedophile priest is killed in the sacristy. As the Circle swells, perpetrators learn to shudder at the sight of business women with knitted briefcases, students with knitted backpacks, roller derby queens with knitted kneepads. They also push back, as organizations of men&mdash;from the Chamber of Commerce to the Department of Agriculture to the Autonomous Federated Association of Coalitions of Anarchists for Spontaneous Insurrectionary Sexual Freedom (the AFACASISF, with their unique musical style: deathvomitnoise)&mdash;issue statements against the Knitting Circle. More sinister is MAWAR (Men Against Women Against Rape), with their Bible Scrabble and their beefcake Jesus calendar&mdash;and a plot to stop the Knitting Circle.</p>

Will Marilyn put down her teenage attitude and pick up her knitting needles? Will Circle member Jasmine find true love with MAWAR&rsquo;s Zebediah?</p>"

Although his classical writings on mutual aid and the philosophy of anarchism are still published today, Peter Kropotkin remains a neglected figure. A talented geographer and a revolutionary socialist, Kropotkin was one of the most important theoreticians of the anarchist movement.</p>
<p>In <em>Kropotkin: The Politics of Community</em>, Brian Morris reaffirms with an attitude of critical sympathy the contemporary relevance of Kropotkin as a political and moral philosopher and as a pioneering social ecologist. Well-researched and wide-ranging, this volume not only presents an important contribution to the history of anarchism, both as a political tradition and as a social movement, but also offers insightful reflections on contemporary debates in political theory and ecological thought. After a short biographical note, the book analyzes in four parts Kropotkin&rsquo;s writings on anarchist communism, agrarian socialism, and integral education; modern science and evolutionary theory; the French Revolution and the modern state; and possessive individualism, terror, and war.</p>
<p>Standing as a comprehensive and engaging introduction to anarchism, social ecology, and the philosophy of evolutionary holism, <em>Kropotkin</em> is written in a straightforward manner that will appeal to those interested in social anarchism and in alternatives to neoliberal doctrines.</p>"

Or have you acted together with your co-workers, made progress, but wondered what to do next? If you are in a union, do you find that it operates top-down just like the boss and ignores the will of its members?</p>
<p><em>Labor Law for the Rank and Filer: Building Solidarity While Staying Clear of the Law</em> is a guerrilla legal handbook for workers in a precarious global economy. It demonstrates how a powerful model of organizing called &ldquo;solidarity unionism&rdquo; can help workers avoid the pitfalls of the legal system and use direct action to win. Blending cutting-edge legal strategies for winning justice at work with a theory of dramatic social change from below, Staughton Lynd and Daniel Gross deliver a practical guide for making work better while reinvigorating the labor movement. The book examines specific cases concerning fundamental labor rights and includes a section on tactics and principles of practicing solidarity unionism. Illustrative stories of workers&rsquo; struggles make the legal principles come alive.</p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> has reported on the book&rsquo;s importance in recent and ongoing labor organizing in the tech industry&mdash;for example among employees of Google, Kickstarter, and Uber, whose union campaigns were influenced by ideas gleaned from <em>Labor Law for the Rank and Filer</em>. Meredith Whittaker, a former Google research scientist who was one of the organizers of the 2018 Google employee walkout, said that the book has been &ldquo;incredibly helpful in thinking through options for action, ways of building collective power, and giving workers who often aren&rsquo;t familiar with labor law some working knowledge that can guide decision making.&rdquo; </p>"

In 2006 and 2007, disputes developed concerning the practice and direction of the 150,000 member healthcare workers union in California, United Healthcare Workers-West (UHW), with its &ldquo;parent&rdquo; organization, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).</p>
<p>SEIU is the second largest union in the US, the fastest growing in recent years. It is a well-organized, well-financed organization, with an ambitious agenda. SEIU perspectives, while packaged as progressive, reject traditional union traditions and practices &ndash; union democracy and the idea of &ldquo;class struggle&rdquo; are replaced with class collaboration, and the union frequently &ldquo;wheels and deals&rdquo; directly with top management and politicians. In 2007 UHW rejected these perspectives and contested them within the union. </p>
<p>The SEIU international leadership retaliated by placing UHW in trusteeship, firing its officers, seizing its assets, and taking control of all union&rsquo;s activities. UHW leaders and members responded by forming a new union, the National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW) and challenging the SEIU in virtually every unionized site in the state.</p>
<p>This California conflict&mdash;SEIU vs. NUHW&mdash;is no local brawl; it is not about personalities, it is not about West Coast eccentricities. Its significance is not confined to the fortunes of just one particular union. SEIU&rsquo;s attack, however regrettable, is not the first such&mdash;nor will it be the last. The truth is that labor has always been divided, comprised of many currents. The truth is also that there are rights and wrongs in labor, as elsewhere, and that these can expose fundamental divides&mdash;in this case two contesting souls in the workers&rsquo; movement. These are sharply on display today in this dispute&mdash;the one soul authoritarian, top-down, collaborationist, the other bottom-up, rank-and-file, class conscious.</p>"

<p>Wally Hope was a visionary and a freethinker, whose life had a profound influence on many in the culture of the UK underground and beyond. He was an important figure in what may loosely be described as the organization of the Windsor Free Festival from 1972 to 1974, as well providing the impetus for the embryonic Stonehenge Free Festival.</p>
<p>Wally was arrested and incarcerated in a mental institution after having been found in possession of a small amount of LSD. He was later released, and subsequently died. The official verdict was that Russell committed suicide, although Rimbaud uncovered strong evidence that he was murdered. Rimbaud&rsquo;s anger over unanswered questions surrounding his friend&rsquo;s death inspired him in 1977 to form the anarchist punk band Crass.</p>
<p>In the space of seven short years, from 1977 to their breakup in 1984, Crass almost single-handedly breathed life back into the then moribund peace and anarchist movements. <em>The Last of the Hippies</em> fast became the seminal text of what was then known as anarcho-punk and which later blossomed into the anti-globalization movement.</p>
<p>This revised edition comes complete with a new introduction in which Rimbaud questions some of the premises that he laid down in the original.</p>"

Le Guin&rsquo;s newest collection of poems, seeks meaning in an ever-connected world. In part evocative of Neruda&rsquo;s <em>Odes to Common Things</em> and Mary Oliver&rsquo;s poetic guides to the natural world, Le Guin gives voice to objects that may not speak a human language but communicate with us nevertheless through and about the seasonal rhythms of the earth, the minute and the vast, the ordinary and the mythological.</p>
<p>As Le Guin herself states, &ldquo;science explicates, poetry implicates.&rdquo; Accordingly, this immersive, tender collection implicates us (in the best sense) in a subjectivity of everyday objects and occurrences. Deceptively simple in form, the poems stand as an invitation both to dive deep and to step outside of ourselves and our common narratives. As readers, we emerge refreshed, having peered underneath cultural constructs toward the necessarily mystical and elemental, no matter how late in the day.</p>
<p>The poems are bookended with two short essays, &ldquo;Deep in Admiration&rdquo; and &ldquo;Form, Free Verse, Free Form: Some Thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2014, the National Book Foundation awarded Le Guin the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, a lifetime achievement award. Her celebrated acceptance speech, which criticized Amazon as a &ldquo;profiteer&rdquo; and praised her fellow authors of fantasy and science fiction, is included in <em>Late in the Day</em> as a postscript. </p>"

Having fled Bolshevik Russia in late 1919, Pyat&rsquo;s progress is a series of leaps from crisis to crisis, as he begins affairs with a Baroness and a Greek prostitute while undertaking schemes to build flying machines in Europe and the United States. His devotion to flamboyantly racist, particularly anti-Semitic doctrines&mdash;like his devotion to cocaine&mdash;remains unabated, and he both sings the praises of Mussolini and lectures across America for the Ku Klux Klan. (His best kept secret is of course, the fact that he is Jewish.)

<p>The <em>Left Behind</em> novels (about the so-called &ldquo;Rapture&rdquo; in which all the born-agains ascend straight to heaven) are among the bestselling Christian books in the United States, describing in lurid detail the adventures of those &ldquo;left behind&rdquo; to battle the Anti-Christ.

Ensminger probes the legacy of punk&rsquo;s sometimes fuzzy political ideology, its ongoing DIY traditions, its rupture of cultural and social norms, its progressive media ecology, its transgenerational and transnational appeal, its pursuit of social justice, its hybrid musical nuances, and its sometimes ambivalent responses to queer identities, race relations, and its own history. Passionate, far-reaching, and fresh, these conversations illuminate punk&rsquo;s oral history with candor and humor.</p>
<p>Rather than focus on discographies and rehashed gig memories, the interviews aim to unveil the secret history of punk and hardcore ideologies and values, as understood by the performers. In addition, Ensminger has culled key graphics from his massive punk flyer collection to celebrate the visual history of the bands represented. The book also features rare photographs shot by Houston-based photographer Ben DeSoto during the heyday of punk and hardcore, which capture the movement&rsquo;s raw gusto, gritty physicality, and resilient determination.</p>

Was it too weak to carry through the revolution? To what extent was the purchase of arms and raw materials from outside sources dependent upon the appearance of a constitutional government inside Republican Spain? What chances had an improvised army of guerrillas against a trained fighting force? These were some of the practical problems facing the revolutionary movement and its leaders.</p>
<p>But in seeking to solve these problems, the anarchists and revolutionary syndicalists were also confronted with other fundamental questions. Could they collaborate with political parties and reformist unions? Given the circumstances, was one form of government to be supported against another? Should the revolutionary impetus of the first days of resistance be halted in the interests of the armed struggle against Franco or be allowed to develop as far as the workers were prepared to take it? Was the situation such that the social revolution could triumph and, if not, what was to be the role of the revolutionary workers?</p>

Born into a middle-class Jewish family, he challenged the conventions of bourgeois society at the turn of the century, engaged in heated debates on the rights of women and homosexuals, and traveled Europe in search of radical communes and artist colonies. He was a primary instigator of the ill-fated Bavarian Council Republic in 1919 and held the libertarian banner high during a Weimar Republic that came under increasing threat by right-wing forces. In 1933, four weeks after Hitler&rsquo;s ascension to power, M&uuml;hsam was arrested in his Berlin home. He spent the last sixteen months of his life in detention and died in the Oranienburg Concentration Camp in July 1934.</p>
<p>M&uuml;hsam wrote poetry, plays, essays, articles, and diaries. His work unites a burning desire for individual liberation with anarcho-communist convictions, and bohemian strains with syndicalist tendencies. The body of his writings is immense, yet hardly any English translations have been available before now. This collection presents not only <em>Liberating Society from the State: What Is Communist Anarchism?</em>, M&uuml;hsam&rsquo;s main political pamphlet and one of the key texts in the history of German anarchism, but also some of his best-known poems, unbending defenses of political prisoners, passionate calls for solidarity with the lumpenproletariat, recollections of the utopian community of Monte Verit&agrave;, debates on the rights of homosexuals and women, excerpts from his journals, and essays contemplating German politics and anarchist theory as much as Jewish identity and the role of intellectuals in the class struggle.</p>

These essays, based on original research and written especially for this collection, reveal some of the enduring sores in the revolutionary socialist movement in order to explore the important, too often neglected left-libertarian currents that have thrived in revolutionary socialist movements. By turns, the collection interrogates the theoretical boundaries between Marxism and anarchism and the process of their formation, the overlaps and creative tensions that shaped left-libertarian theory and practice, and the stumbling blocks to movement cooperation. Bringing together specialists working from a range of political perspectives, the book charts a history of radical twentieth-century socialism, and opens new vistas for research in the twenty-first.

James, Hardt and Negri&mdash;and key movements including the Situationist International, Socialisme ou Barbarie and Council Communism. Analysis of activism in the UK, Australasia, and the U.S. serves as the prism to discuss syndicalism, carnival anarchism, and the anarchistic currents in the U.S. civil rights movement.</p>

<p>The editor, Vernon Richards, has translated hundreds of articles by Malatesta, taken from the journals Malatesta either edited himself or contributed to, from the earliest, <em>L&rsquo;En Dehors</em> of 1892, through to <em>Pensiero e Volont&agrave;</em>, which was forced to close by Mussolini&rsquo;s fascists in 1926, and the bilingual <em>Il Risveglio/Le R&eacute;veil</em>, which published most of his writings after that date. These articles have been pruned down to their essentials and collected under subheadings ranging from &ldquo;Ends and Means&rdquo; to &ldquo;Anarchist Propaganda.&rdquo; Through the selections Malatesta&rsquo;s classical anarchism emerges: a revolutionary, nonpacifist, nonreformist vision informed by decades of engagement in struggle and study.

They are depicted as romanticized villains on the one hand and as genuine social rebels on the other. <em>Life Under the Jolly Roger</em> examines the political and cultural significance of these nomadic outlaws by relating historical accounts to a wide range of theoretical concepts&mdash;reaching from Marshall Sahlins and Pierre Clastres to Mao Zedong and Eric J. Hobsbawm via Friedrich Nietzsche and Michel Foucault. With daring theoretical speculation and passionate, respectful inquiry, Gabriel Kuhn skillfully contextualizes and analyzes the meanings of race, gender, sexuality, and disability in golden age pirate communities, while also surveying the breathtaking array of pirates&rsquo; forms of organization, economy, and ethics.</p>
<p><em>Life Under the Jolly Roger</em> also provides an extensive catalog of scholarly references for the academic reader. Yet this delightful and engaging study is written in language that is wholly accessible for a wide audience.</p>
<p>This expanded second edition includes two new prefaces and an appendix with interviews about contemporary piracy, the ongoing fascination with pirate imagery, and the thorny issue of colonial implications in the romanticization of pirates.</p>"

In the tar sands of Alberta, the oil industry is using vast quantities of water and natural gas to produce synthetic crude oil, creating drastically high levels of greenhouse gas emissions and air and water pollution. But tar sands opponents&mdash;fighting a powerful international industry&mdash;are likened to terrorists, government environmental scientists are muzzled, and public hearings are concealed and rushed.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the formidable political and economic power behind the tar sands, many opponents are actively building international networks of resistance, challenging pipeline plans while resisting threats to Indigenous sovereignty and democratic participation. Including leading voices involved in the struggle against the tar sands, <em>A Line in the Tar Sands</em> offers a critical analysis of the impact of the tar sands and the challenges opponents face in their efforts to organize effective resistance.</p>

From the safe distance that wealth buys, a corporation called Vexcorp counts these lives as another expense on a balance sheet. But that distance is about to collapse.</p>
<p>Malia is an activist who has fiercely fought the everyday atrocities of environmental racism. After years of watching countless children die, she&rsquo;s lost faith in the possibility of systemic reform. Dennis is a lawyer who still believes that if enough people have the correct information they will do the right thing. Dujuan is a young street thug torn by a chaos of grief and rage at his little sister&rsquo;s death. And Larry Gordon is Vexcorp&rsquo;s CEO. </p>
<p>Their lives converge when Dujuan mugs Malia. Her scornful comparison of Dujuan to Vexcorp triggers a storm inside him. That storm only clears when he identifies the real agent of his pain: Larry Gordon. Injury requires justice, so Dujuan kidnaps Gordon and assembles a rough court to try him for murder. He picks Malia to be the judge because she knows the facts and because, as Dujuan says, &ldquo;You want this as bad as me.&rdquo; As bystanders become involved and time runs out, Malia is forced to make grueling moral decisions between survival and loyalty, safety and courage, agency and despair.</p>

The book opens with a detailed description of what it was like to live and work in one of the heaviest industrial concentrations in the world. The author takes the reader on a walk through the heart of the South Side of Chicago, observing the noise, heavy traffic, the 24-hour restaurants and bars, the rich diversity of people on the streets at all hours of the day and night, and the smell of the highly polluted air.</p>
<p>Factory life includes stints at a machine shop, a shortening factory, a railroad car factory, a structural steel shop, a box factory, a chemical plant, and a paper cup factory. Along the way there is a wildcat strike, an immigration raid, shop-floor actions protesting supervisor abuses, serious injuries, a failed effort to unionize, and a murder. Ranney&rsquo;s emphasis is on race and class relations, working conditions, environmental issues, and broader social issues in the 1970s that impacted the shop floor.</p>
<p>Forty years later, the narrator returns to Chicago&rsquo;s South Side to reveal what happened to the communities, buildings, and the companies that had inhabited them. <em>Living and Dying on the Factory Floor</em> concludes with discussions on the nature of work; racism, race, and class; the use of immigration policy for social control; and our ability to create a just society.</p>"

He reveals the natural anarchism of our everyday lives, and in doing so, enlarges the possibilities for a truly human society, in which our imaginations, our compassion, can have full play.&rdquo; &mdash;Howard Zinn, author of <em>A People&rsquo;s History of the United States</em>, from the Introduction</p>
<p>At the end of the nineteenth century, the network of anarchist collectives represented the first-ever global antisystemic movement and the very center of revolutionary tumult. In this groundbreaking and magisterial work, Žiga Vodovnik establishes that anarchism today is not only the most revolutionary current but, for the first time in history, the only one left. According to the author, many contemporary theoretical reflections on anarchism marginalize or neglect to mention the relevance of the anarchy of everyday life. Given this myopic (mis)conception of its essence, we are still searching for anarchism in places where the chances of actually finding it are the smallest.</p>"

He has won almost all the major Science Fiction, Fantasy, and lifetime achievement awards including the &ldquo;Howie,&rdquo; the Prix Utopiales and the Stoker. Best known for his rule-breaking SF and Fantasy, including the classic Elric and Hawkmoon series, he is also the author of several graphic novels.</p>
<p>Now, in <em>London Peculiar and Other Nonfiction</em>, Michael Moorcock personally selects the best of his published, unpublished, and uncensored essays, articles, reviews, and opinions covering a wide range of subjects: books, films, politics, reminiscences of old friends, and attacks on new foes. Drawn from over fifty years of writing, including his most recent work from the pages of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and the <em>Guardian</em>, along with obscure and now unobtainable sources, the pieces in <em>London Peculiar and Other Nonfiction</em> showcase Moorcock at his acerbic best. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;London Peculiar,&rdquo; an impassioned statement of Moorcock&rsquo;s memories of wartime London. The architectural &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; wrought by the rebuilding of the city after World War Two brought cultural changes as well, many to the detriment of the city&rsquo;s inhabitants.</li>
<li>Review of R. Crumb&rsquo;s <em>Genesis</em>, previously unavailable in English, this lengthy review of the underground comic artist&rsquo;s retelling of the first book of the Bible leads Moorcock to address nostalgia for the sixties.</li>
<li>&ldquo;A Child&rsquo;s Christmas in the Blitz&rdquo;&mdash;An autobiographical recounting of Moorcock&rsquo;s childhood in wartime London, with memories of the freedom and hardships he encountered during the bombings, and the happy times he spent with his parents.</li>
</ul>
<p>These, along with dozens more, make this a collection Moorcock fans won&rsquo;t want to miss, and the perfect introduction for new readers who will soon discover why Alan Moore (<em>Watchmen</em>) says: &ldquo;Moorcock seizes the 21st century bull by its horns and wrestles it into submission with a Texan rodeo confidence.&rdquo;</p>"

Though some among the group had hardly even met one another, the 21 were rounded up by the FBI and New York Police Department in an attempt to disrupt and destroy the organization that was attracting young people around the world. Involving charges of conspiracy to commit violent acts, the Panther 21 trial&mdash;the longest and most expensive in New York history&mdash;revealed the illegal government activities which led to exile, imprisonment on false charges, and assassination of Black liberation leaders. Solidarity for the 21 also extended well beyond &ldquo;movement&rdquo; circles and included mainstream publication of their collective autobiography, <em>Look for Me in the Whirlwind</em>, which is reprinted here for the first time.</p>
<p><em>Look for Me in the Whirlwind: From the Panther 21 to 21st-Century Revolutions</em> contains the entire original manuscript, and includes new commentary from surviving members of the 21: Sekou Odinga, Dhoruba Bin Wahad, Jamal Joseph, and Shaba Om. Still-imprisoned Sundiata Acoli, Imam Jamil Al-Amin, and Mumia Abu-Jamal contribute new essays. Never or rarely seen poetry and prose from Afeni Shakur, Kuwasi Balagoon, Ali Bey Hassan, and Michael &ldquo;Cetewayo&rdquo; Tabor is included. Early Panther leader and jazz master Bilal Sunni-Ali adds a historical essay and lyrics from his composition &ldquo;Look for Me in the Whirlwind,&rdquo; and coeditors kioni-sadiki, Meyer, and Panther rank-and-file member Cyril &ldquo;Bullwhip&rdquo; Innis Jr. help bring the story up to date.</p>
<p>At a moment when the Movement for Black Lives recites the affirmation that &ldquo;it is our duty to win,&rdquo; penned by Black Liberation Army (BLA) militant Assata Shakur, those who made up the BLA and worked alongside of Assata are largely unknown. This book&mdash;with archival photos from David Fenton, Stephen Shames, and the private collections of the authors&mdash; provides essential parts of a hidden and missing-in-action history. Going well beyond the familiar and mythologized nostalgic Panther narrative, <em>From the Panther 21 to 21st-Century Revolutions</em> explains how and why the Panther legacy is still relevant and vital today.</p>"

From the early anti-Vietnam War protests to the founding of SDS, from the Columbia Strike to the tragedy of the Townhouse, Gilbert was on the scene: as organizer, theoretician, and above all, activist. He was among the first militants who went underground to build the clandestine resistance to war and racism known as &ldquo;Weatherman.&rdquo; And he was among the last to emerge, in captivity, after the disaster of the 1981 Brink&rsquo;s robbery, an attempted expropriation that resulted in four deaths and long prison terms. In this extraordinary memoir, written from the maximum-security prison where he has lived for almost thirty years, Gilbert tells the intensely personal story of his own Long March from liberal to radical to revolutionary.</p>
<p>Today a beloved and admired mentor to a new generation of activists, he assesses with rare humor, with an understanding stripped of illusions, and with uncommon candor the errors and advances, terrors and triumphs of the Sixties and beyond. It&rsquo;s a battle that was far from won, but is still not lost: the struggle to build a new world, and the love that drives that effort. A cautionary tale and a how-to as well, <em>Love and Struggle</em> is a book as candid, uncompromising, and humane as its author.</p>"

White, female, 26, convicted of nighttime breaking and entering with force, she works in the prison law library, giving legal counsel of more-or-mostly-less usefulness to other convicts. More useful is the hooch stash she keeps behind the law books.</p>

At the maximum-security Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, Ohio, prisoners seized a major area of the prison on Easter Sunday, 1993. More than 400 prisoners held L block for eleven days. Nine prisoners alleged to have been informants, or &ldquo;snitches,&rdquo; and one hostage correctional officer, were murdered. There was a negotiated surrender. Thereafter, almost wholly on the basis of testimony by prisoner informants who received deals in exchange, five spokespersons or leaders were tried and sentenced to death, and more than a dozen others received long sentences.</p>
<p><em>Lucasville</em> examines the causes of the disturbance, what happened during the eleven days, and the fairness of the trials. Particular emphasis is placed on the interracial character of the action, as evidenced in the slogans that were found painted on walls after the surrender: &ldquo;Black and White Together,&rdquo; &ldquo;Convict Unity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Convict Race.&rdquo; </p>
<p>An eloquent Foreword by Mumia Abu-Jamal underlines these themes. He states, as does the book, that the men later sentenced to death &ldquo;sought to minimize violence, and indeed, according to substantial evidence, saved the lives of several men, prisoner and guard alike.&rdquo; Of the five men, three black and two white, who were sentenced to death, Mumia declares, &ldquo;They rose above their status as prisoners, and became, for a few days in April 1993, what rebels in Attica had demanded a generation before them: men. As such, they did not betray each other; they did not dishonor each other; they reached beyond their prison &lsquo;tribes&rsquo; to reach commonality.&rdquo;</p>"

His bestselling <em>Mars Trilogy</em> tells the epic story of the future colonization of the red planet, and the revolution that inevitably follows. <em>The Years of Rice and Salt</em> is based on a devastatingly simple idea: If the medieval plague had wiped out all of Europe, what would our world look like today? His novel <em>Galileo&rsquo;s Dream</em> is a stunning combination of historical drama and far-flung space opera, in which the ten dimensions of the universe itself are rewoven to ensnare history&rsquo;s most notorious torturers.</p>

But how did these politics first emerge? And what do they offer activists today, who seek to transform capitalist society at its very foundations?</p>
<p><em>Maoism and the Chinese Revolution</em> offers the novice reader a sweeping overview of five decades of Maoist revolutionary history. It covers the early years of the Chinese Communist Party, through decades of guerrilla warfare and rapid industrialization, to the massive upheavals of the Cultural Revolution. It traces the development of Mao Zedong&rsquo;s military and political strategy, philosophy, and statecraft amid the growing contradictions of the Chinese revolutionary project. All the while, it maintains a perspective sympathetic to the everyday workers and peasants who lived under the party regime, and who in some moments stood poised to make the revolution anew.</p>
<p>From the ongoing &ldquo;people&rsquo;s wars&rdquo; in the Global South, to the radical lineages of many black, Latino, and Asian revolutionaries in the Global North, Maoist politics continue to resonate today.

He was active as a leader in the Black Liberation Movement in Philadelphia, both above and underground. His successful escapes from maximum-security prisons earned him the title &ldquo;Maroon.&rdquo; This is the first published collection of his accumulated written works, and also includes new essays written expressly for this volume.</p>
<p>Despite the torture and deprivation that has been everyday life for Maroon over the last several decades, he has remained at the cutting edge of history through his writings. His work is innovative and revolutionary on multiple levels:<br /> &bull; His self-critical and fresh retelling of the Black liberation struggle in the U.S. includes many practical and theoretical insights; <br /> &bull; His analysis of the prison system, particularly in relation to capitalism, imperialism, and the drug war, takes us far beyond the recently-popular analysis of the Prison Industrial Complex, contained in books such as <em>The New Jim Crow</em>; <br /> &bull; His historical research and writings on Maroon communities throughout the Americas, drawing many insights from these societies in the fields of political and military revolutionary strategy are unprecedented; and finally<br /> &bull; His sharp and profound understanding of the current historical moment, with clear proposals for how to move forward embracing new political concepts and practices (including but not limited to eco-socialism, matriarchy and eco-feminism, food security, prefiguration and the Occupy Wall Street movement) provide cutting-edge challenges for today&rsquo;s movements for social change.</p>"

<p>The author of <em>Men in Prison</em> served five years in French penitentiaries (1912&ndash;1917) for the crime of &ldquo;criminal association&rdquo;&mdash;in fact for his courageous refusal to testify against his old comrades, the infamous &ldquo;Tragic Bandits&rdquo; of French anarchism. &ldquo;While I was still in prison,&rdquo; Serge later recalled, &ldquo;fighting off tuberculosis, insanity, depression, the spiritual poverty of the men, the brutality of the regulations, I already saw one kind of justification of that infernal voyage in the possibility of describing it. Among the thousands who suffer and are crushed in prison&mdash;and how few men really know that prison!&mdash;I was perhaps the only one who could try one day to tell all&hellip; There is no novelist&rsquo;s hero in this novel, unless that terrible machine, prison, is its real hero. It is not about &lsquo;me,&rsquo; about a few men, but about men, all men crushed in that dark corner of society.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Ironically, Serge returned to writing upon his release from a GPU prison in Soviet Russia, where he was arrested as an anti-Stalinist subversive in 1928. He completed <em>Men in Prison</em> (and two other novels) in &ldquo;semi-captivity&rdquo; before he was rearrested and deported to the Gulag in 1933. Serge&rsquo;s classic prison novel has been compared to Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s <em>House of the Dead</em>, Koestler&rsquo;s <em>Spanish Testament</em>, Genet&rsquo;s <em>Miracle of the Rose</em>, and Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s <em>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch</em> both for its authenticity and its artistic achievement.</p>
<p>This edition features a substantial new introduction by translator Richard Greeman, situating the work in Serge&rsquo;s life and times.</p>"

Sok co-founded of the internationally acclaimed independent Dutch music group The Ex in 1979. He became the singer and lyricist, more or less by coincidence, since he wrote the occasional poem and nobody else wanted to sing. At the same time he turned himself into a graphic designer of record sleeves, posters, and books. Together with The Ex he was awarded the Dutch Pop Prize of 1991. The band is well known for their energetic live performances, inventive music, and politically outspoken and thought-provoking lyrics. After 1,400 concerts in Holland and abroad, and 25 record albums later, G.W. Sok decided to leave the group at the end of 2008. <br /> <br /> <em>A Mix of Bricks &amp; Valentines</em> showcases the lyrics G.W. Sok wrote during his three-decade period of Ex-istence. More than 250 songs of agitprop lyrics, poetry, and rantings are included along with an introduction by the author discussing his development as a writer. A foreword by English journalist, author, and musician John Robb (the Membranes, <em>Punk: An Oral History</em> and <em>Death to Trad Rock</em>) puts the work of G.W. Sok into perspective. <br /> <br /> <em>A Mix of Bricks &amp; Valentines</em> is written with a sharp pen; provocative, creative, and witty, everything punk and art intended to be from the start. And yes, it can be quite loud at times, too.</p>"

<p>Moorcock&rsquo;s own literary accomplishments include his classic <em>Mother London</em>, a romp through urban history conducted by psychic outsiders; his comic <em>Pyat</em> quartet, in which a Jewish antisemite examines the roots of the Nazi Holocaust; <em>Behold The Man</em>, the tale of a time tourist who fills in for Christ on the cross; and of course the eternal hero <em>Elric</em>, swordswinger, hellbringer and bestseller.</p>

With that change our problems will not be solved overnight, but we will be able to tackle them with confidence. Such are the difficulties, contradictions, and antagonisms; and in the solution of them society moves forward and men and women feel they have a role in the development of their social surroundings. It is in this movement that we have the possibility of a good life.&rdquo; &mdash;C.L.R. James, from <em>Modern Politics</em></p>
<p>This volume provides a brilliant and accessible summation of the ideas of left Marxist giant C.L.R. James. Originally delivered in 1960 as a series of lectures in his native Trinidad, these writings powerfully display his wide-ranging erudition and enduring relevance. From his analysis of revolutionary history (from the Athenian City-States through the English Revolution, Russian Revolution, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956), to the role of literature, art, and culture in society (from Charlie Chaplin to Pablo Picasso, via Camus and Eisenstein), to an interrogation of the ideas and philosophy of such thinkers as Rousseau, Lenin, and Trotsky, this is a magnificent tour de force from a critically engaged thinker at the height of his powers. An essential introduction to a body of work as necessary and illuminating for this century as it proved for the last.</p>"

This book contains new oral history by key figures of the Rotisken'rhakéhte's revival in the 1970s, and tells the story of the Warriors’ famous flag, their armed occupation of Ganienkeh in 1974, and the role of their constitution, the Great Peace, in guiding their commitment to freedom and independence. We hear directly the story of how the Kanien'kehá:ka Longhouse became one the most militant resistance groups in North America, gaining international attention with the Oka Crisis of 1990. This auto-history of the Rotisken'rhakéhte is complemented by a Mohawk history timeline from colonization to the present, a glossary of Mohawk political philosophy, and a new map of Iroquoia in Mohawk language. At last, the Mohawk Warriors can tell their own story with their own voices, and to serve as an example and inspiration for future generations struggling against the environmental, cultural, and social devastation cast upon the modern world.</p>"

Jim Nisbet&rsquo;s novella is ripped from the zeitgeist of the &rsquo;80s, and set in a sex-drenched San Francisco, where the computer becomes the protagonist&rsquo;s co-conspirator and both writer and machine seem to threaten the written word itself.</p>
<p>The City as whore provides a backdrop oozing with drugs, poets and danger. Nisbet has written a madcap meditation on the angst of a writer caught in a world where the rent is due, new technology offers up illicit ways to produce the latest bestseller, and the detective and other characters of the imagination might just sidle up to the bar and buy you a drink in real life. The world of <em>A Moment of Doubt</em> is the world of phone sex, bars and bordellos, AIDS, and the lure of hacking. Coming up against the rules of the game&mdash;the detective genre itself&mdash;has never been such a nasty and gender-defying challenge.</p>

The hairs on the back on your arms stand up. You get goosebumps. There&rsquo;s a tingling in your spine. Your heart is racing. Your eyes shine and all your senses are heightened: sights, sounds, smells are all more intense. Somebody brushes past you, skin on skin, and you feel sparks. Even the acrid rasp of tear gas at the back of your throat becomes addictive, whilst a sip of water has come from the purest mountain spring. You have an earnest conversation with the total stranger standing next to you and it feels completely normal. (Not something that happens too often in the checkout queue at the supermarket.) Everybody is more attractive. You can&rsquo;t stop grinning. Fuck knows what endorphins your brain&rsquo;s producing, but it feels great. Collectivity is visceral!</p>
<p>The first decade of the twenty-first century was marked by a series of global summits which seemed to assume ever-greater importance&mdash;from the WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle at the end of 1999, through the G8 summits at Genoa, Evian and Gleneagles, up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15) at Copenhagen in 2009.</p>
<p>But these global summits did not pass uncontested. Alongside and against them, there unfolded a different version of globalization. <em>Moments of Excess</em> is a collection of texts which offer an insider analysis of this cycle of counter-summit mobilisations. It weaves lucid descriptions of the intensity of collective action into a more sober reflection on the developing problematics of the &lsquo;movement of movements&rsquo;. The collection examines essential questions concerning the character of anti-capitalist movements, and the very meaning of movement; the relationship between intensive collective experiences&mdash;&lsquo;moments of excess&rsquo;&mdash;and &lsquo;everyday life&rsquo;; and the tensions between open, all-inclusive, &lsquo;constitutive&rsquo; practices, on the one hand, and the necessity of closure, limits and antagonism, on the other.</p>
<p><em>Moments of Excess</em> includes a new introduction explaining the origin of the texts and their relation to event-based politics, and a postscript which explores new possibilities for anti-capitalist movements in the midst of crisis.</p>"

These stories are not about mythical creatures; here, the creatures speak for themselves. There&rsquo;s an orc who hates Tolkien, a young demon awash in teenage angst, an angel abandoned by Jesus who finds the Fates. Jensen creates a world both delicately dreamlike and all too real, where the villain is sometimes the victim and evil is not always what we thought.</p>
<p>If stories teach us how to be human, then the stories in Monsters are the ones we need now. These are fractured fairy tales for grown-ups, where the roots of sadism are laid bare and the horrors of human supremacism are firmly faced. But as in all of Jensen&rsquo;s work, love is both always possible and also a call to action. By turns macabre, melancholy, and magical, these stories and their accompanying images will leave you wondering who the real monsters are and how they can be defeated.</p>"

They may feel that what they did was unforgivable. In this thoughtful book culled from a wide range of experiences, Alice and Staughton Lynd introduce readers to what modern clinicians, philosophers, and theologians have attempted to describe as &ldquo;moral injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moral injury, if not overcome, can lead to an individual giving up, turning to drugs, alcohol, or suicide. But moral injury can also demand that one turn one&rsquo;s life around. It offers hope because it indicates resistance to the use of violence that offends a sense of decency. Within the military and in prisons&mdash;institutions created to use force and violence against perceived enemies&mdash;there have arisen new forms of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to violence. From combat veterans of America&rsquo;s foreign wars to Israeli refuseniks, and from &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; criminals in supermax confinement in Ohio to hunger strikers in California&rsquo;s Pelican Bay prison, the Lynds give us the voices of those breaking the cycle of violence with courageous acts of nonviolent resistance.</p>
<p>As we become more awake to the horrors that we as a society have done or failed to prevent, and when we become aware of what conscience demands of us in the face of recognizable violations of fundamental human rights, we may take heart from the exemplary actions by individuals and groups of individuals described in this book.</p>"

Broken down into a series of core points and actions plans, <em>Muse-Sick</em> is a concise and affordable pocket primer follow-up to Brennan&rsquo;s two previous music missives, <em>How Music Dies (or Lives): Field Recording and the Battle for Democracy</em> in the arts and <em>Silenced by Sound: The Music Meritocracy Myth.</em></p>

<p>Popular culture has woven itself into the social fabric of our lives, penetrating people&rsquo;s homes and haunting their psyche through images and earworm hooks. Justice, at most levels, is something that the average citizen might have little influence upon leaving us feeling helpless and complacent. But pop music is a neglected arena where some change can concretely occur&mdash;by exercising active and thoughtful choices to reject the low-hanging, omnipresent commercialized and pre-packaged fruit, we begin to re-balance the world, one engaged listener at a time.</p>

<p>In fifty-nine concise and clear points, Brennan reveals how corporate media has constricted local culture and individual creativity, leading to a lack of diversity within &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; <em>Muse-Sick&rsquo;s </em>narrative portions are driven and made corporeal via the author&rsquo;s ongoing field-recording chronicles with widely disparate groups, such as the Sheltered Workshop Singers.

It is often forgotten that Kropotkin was also a world-renowned geographer whose seminal critique of the hypothesis of competition promoted by Social Darwinism helped revolutionize modern evolutionary theory. An admirer of Darwin, he used his observations of life in Siberia as the basis for his 1902 collection of essays <em>Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution</em>. Kropotkin demonstrated that mutually beneficial cooperation and reciprocity&mdash;in both individuals and as a species&mdash;plays a far more important role in the animal kingdom and human societies than does individualized competitive struggle. Kropotkin carefully crafted his theory making the science accessible. His account of nature rejected Rousseau&rsquo;s romantic depictions and ethical socialist ideas that cooperation was motivated by the notion of &ldquo;universal love.&rdquo; His understanding of the dynamics of social evolution shows us that the power of cooperation&mdash;whether it is bison defending themselves against a predator or workers unionizing against their boss. His message is clear: solidarity is strength!</p>



<p>Every page of this new edition of <em>Mutual Aid</em> has been beautifully illustrated by one of anarchism&rsquo;s most celebrated current artists, N.O. Bonzo. The reader will also enjoy original artwork by GATS and insightful commentary by David Graeber, Ruth Kinna, Andrej Grubacic, and Allan Antliff.</p>"

The short essays, poems, and personal memoirs intermingle like shards of glass that shine, reflect&mdash;and cut. Always personal yet always political, Piercy&rsquo;s work is drawn from a deep well of feminist and political activism.</p>

Murphy,Illustrated by,Tatiana Gill,Producer,Shout Your Abortion,Afterword by,Amelia Bonow,,,,,,,13.95,"<p><em>My Mom Had an Abortion</em></span><span> is a unique coming-of-age tale told by a self-described dyslexic-asexual-lesbian-feminist teenager and illustrated by body-positive comic artist Tatiana Gill. We follow our protagonist Beezus B. Murphy as she chronicles her evolving understanding of menstruation, reproduction, and abortion and finds her place in a confusing world. Initially influenced by harmful narratives in pop media such as the &ldquo;the pregnant teenager&rdquo; cliche, we watch Beezus&rsquo;s ideas change as her body changes and as she learns more about the intricacies of her family history and her mom&rsquo;s own reproductive experiences. She grows from a confused, out-of-place kid into a self-assured, empathetic, and strong-willed activist teen. As Beezus says, &ldquo;People shouldn&rsquo;t be shamed for getting or not getting abortions. Young people absorb the information that we gather from our surroundings. Sometimes it&rsquo;s good information and other times it can be harmful. But now I realize abortion is perfectly normal and should be kept safe and legal.&rdquo; Sprinkled with pop culture references, hilariously apt descriptions of unwanted body changes and menstruation like the chapter &ldquo;Blood, Bath, and Beyond,&rdquo; and instantly understandable revelations of growing-up, this beautifully illustrated short graphic novel crucially fills a cultural gap around complexities of abortion, pop culture, body changes, and finding out where we fit in.</p>"

<p>Dietzgen examines what we do when we think. He discovered that thinking is a process involving two opposing processes: generalization, and specialization. All thought is therefore a dialectical process. Our knowledge is inherently limited however, which makes truth relative and the seeking of truth on-going. The only absolute is existence itself, or the universe, everything else is limited or relative. Although a philosophical materialist, he extended these concepts to include all that was real, existing or had an impact upon the world. Thought and matter were no longer radically separated as in older forms of materialism. <em>The Nature of Human Brain Work</em> is vital for theorists today in that it lays the basis for a non-dogmatic, flexible, non-sectarian, yet principled socialist politics.</p>"

The story begins with a miracle. A homeless boy sees a whale washed up on the beach. He alerts the local fishermen, and soon the whole town is trying and failing to push it back into the ocean. With just the boy left to accompany the whale now in its dying throes, a freak wave pulls the creature back into the sea. This is an omen. Change is coming.</p>



<p>The boy and the washerwoman who adopts him cobble together a ramshackle army of fishermen, shopkeepers, lapsed nuns, anarchist bats, and an itinerant camel. They attempt to end the reign of the dictator who rules over Balaal. Their attempt involves pitched battles, farcical trials, rooftop escapes, and sun-parched wanderings in the wilderness. Looming over the disparate cast of characters is the legend of the giant wave&mdash;Nazar&eacute;&mdash;that will one day annihilate everyone and everything in the city.</p>



<p><em>Nazar&eacute;</em> is an adventure and a parable that pits the oppressed against the oppressor. The work has been likened to that of Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez and Mario Vargas Llosa in its use of language, its inventiveness, its humor, and its examination of issues of justice.</p>"

But when Kate invites the wrong drifter home for the night, the delicate peace of their domain is shattered.</p>
<p>Troy Mason manages to hang onto Kate for a few weeks, though his charm increasingly fails to offset his lies and delusions of grandeur. It is only a matter of time before the lies turn abusive, igniting a chain reaction of violence and murder. Not even a bullet in the leg will keep Troy from seeking revenge as he chases the missing Ruby over back roads through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, down the River of No Return, and to a white supremacy enclave in Idaho&rsquo;s Bitterroot Wilderness. <em>Nearly Nowhere</em> explores the darkest places of the American West, emerging with only a fragile hope of redemption in the maternal ties that bind.</p>

Instead, Vincent goes back to his midwestern roots to play a humble but important role in the reinvention of American cuisine while bringing the table back to the center of American life.</p>
<p>Weaving together small town values, personal stories, and 120 great recipes, <em>New American Vegan</em> delivers authentically American food that simply has to be tasted to be believed. Recipes range from very basic to the modestly complicated, but always with an eye on creating something that is both beautiful and delicious while keeping it simple. Clear instructions provide step-by-steps, but also help new cooks find their feet in the kitchen, with a whole chapter devoted just to terms, tools, and techniques. With an eye towards improvisation, the book provides a detailed basic recipe that&rsquo;s good as-is, but also provides additional notes that explain how to take each recipe further, increase flavor, add drama to the presentation, or add a little extra flourish for new cooks and seasoned kitchen veterans alike.</p>"

Most unions have surrendered the achievements of the mid-twentieth century, when the working class was a militant force for change throughout the world. Now trade unions seem incapable of defending, let alone advancing, workers&rsquo; interests.</p>
<p>As unions implode and weaken, workers are independently forming their own unions, drawing on the tradition of syndicalism and autonomism&mdash;a resurgence of self-directed action that augurs a new period of class struggle throughout the world. In Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe, workers are rejecting leaders and forming authentic class-struggle unions rooted in sabotage, direct action, and striking to achieve concrete gains.</p>
<p>This is the first book to compile workers&rsquo; struggles on a global basis, examining the formation and expansion of radical unions in the Global South and Global North. The tangible evidence marshaled in this book serves as a handbook for understanding the formidable obstacles and concrete opportunities for workers challenging neoliberal capitalism, even as the unions of the old decline and disappear.</p>

James,Introduction by,Noel Ignatiev,,,,,,,,,,,16.95,"<p>C.L.R. James was a leading figure in the independence movement in the West Indies, and the black and working-class movements in both Britain and the United States. As a major contributor to Marxist and revolutionary theory, his project was to discover, document, and elaborate the aspects of working-class activity that constitute the revolution in today&rsquo;s world. In this volume, Noel Ignatiev, author of <em>How the Irish Became White</em>, provides an extensive introduction to James&rsquo; life and thought, before presenting two critical works that together illustrate the tremendous breadth and depth of James&rsquo; worldview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Invading Socialist Society,&rdquo; for James the fundamental document of his political tendency, shows clearly the power of James&rsquo; political acumen and its relevance in today&rsquo;s world with a clarity of analysis that anticipated future events to a remarkable extent. &ldquo;Every Cook Can Govern,&rdquo; is a short and eminently readable piece counterpoising direct with representative democracy, and getting to the heart of how we should relate to one another. Together these two works represent the principal themes that run through James&rsquo;s life: implacable hostility toward all &ldquo;condescending saviors&rdquo; of the working class, and undying faith in the power of ordinary people to build a new world.</p>"

Fisher,,,,,,,,,,,20.00,"<p><em>New Reformation</em> was Paul Goodman&rsquo;s last book of social criticism. The man who set the agenda for the Youth Movement of the Sixties with his best-selling <em>Growing Up Absurd</em>, and who wrote a book a year to keep his &ldquo;crazy young allies&rdquo; focused on the issues as he saw them, stepped back in 1970 to re-assess the results of what he considered a moral and spiritual upheaval comparable to the Protestant Reformation&mdash;&ldquo;the breakdown of belief, and the emergence of new belief, in sciences and professions, education, and civil legitimacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael Fisher&rsquo;s introduction situates Goodman in his era and traces the development of his characteristic insights, now the common wisdom of every radical critique of American society.

<p>This conversational interview by Michael Albert, who has been close to Chomsky for roughly half a century and talked with him many hundreds of times, spans a wide range of topics including journalism, science, religion, the racist foundations of American society, education as indoctrination, issues of class and resistance, colonialism, imperialism, and much more. The thread through it all is that every topic&mdash;and the list above takes us just about halfway through this book&mdash;reveals how social systems work, what their impact on humanity is, and how they are treated by the elite, mainstream intellectuals, and leftists. It gets personal, theoretical, and observational. The lessons are relevant to all times, so far, and pretty much all places, and Chomsky&rsquo;s logical scalpel, with moral guidance, is relentless. </p>"

Was it perpetually at odds with other currents of the Left? The authors in this collection take up these questions of geographical and political peripheries. Building on recent research that has emphasized the plural origins of anarchist thought and practice, they reflect on the histories and cultures of the antistatist mutual aid movements of the last century beyond the boundaries of an artificially coherent Europe. At the same time, they reexamine the historical relationships between anarchism and communism without starting from the position of sectarian difference (Marxism versus anarchism). Rather, they look at how anarchism and communism intersected; how the insurgent Left could appear&mdash;and in fact was&mdash;much more ecumenical, capacious, and eclectic than frequently portrayed; and reveal that such capaciousness is a hallmark of anarchist practice, which is prefigurative in its politics and antihierarchical and antidogmatic in its ethics.</p>

Adding to a growing constellation of conversations that push against this narrative, <em>Nourishing Resistance</em> centers the role of everyday people in acts of culinary solidarity.<br></p><p>Twenty-three contributors—cooks, farmers, writers, organizers, academics, and dreamers—write on queer potlucks, BIPOC-centered farms and gardens, rebel ancestors, disability justice, indigenous food sovereignty, and the fight against toxic diet culture, among many other topics. They recount bowls of biryani at a Delhi protest, fricasé de conejo on a Puerto Rican farm, pay-as-you-want dishes in a collectively-run Hong Kong restaurant, and lemon cake cooked in a New Jersey disaster relief kitchen. They chronicle the communal kitchens and food distribution programs that emerged in Buenos Aires and New York City in the wake of COVID-19, which caused surging food insecurity worldwide. They look to the past, revealing how “Bella Ciao” was composed by striking women rice workers, and the future, speculating on postcapitalist worlds that include both high-tech collective farms and herbs gathered beside highways.</p><p>Through essays, articles, poems, and stories, <em>Nourishing Resistance</em> argues that food is a central, intrinsic part of global struggles for autonomy and collective liberation.</p>"

The Illuminati were a network of intellectuals who argued for self-government and against private property, yet the public is now often told that they were (and are) the very group that controls governments and defends private property around the world. Intervening in such misinformation, Lagalisse works with primary and secondary sources in multiple languages to set straight the history of the Left and illustrate the actual relationship between revolutionism, pantheistic occult philosophy, and the clandestine fraternity.</p>
<p>Exploring hidden correspondences between anarchism, Renaissance magic, and New Age movements, Lagalisse also advances critical scholarship regarding leftist attachments to secular politics. Inspired by anthropological fieldwork within today&rsquo;s anarchist movements, her essay challenges anarchist atheism insofar as it poses practical challenges for coalition politics in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>Studying anarchism as a historical object, <em>Occult Features of Anarchism</em> also shows how the development of leftist theory and practice within clandestine masculine public spheres continues to inform contemporary anarchist understandings of the &ldquo;political,&rdquo; in which men&rsquo;s oppression by the state becomes the prototype for power in general. Readers behold how gender and religion become privatized in radical counterculture, a historical process intimately linked to the privatization of gender and religion by the modern nation-state.</p>"

We have pinned our future to an economic system that centralizes power in fewer and fewer hands, and whose benefits increasingly flow to smaller and smaller numbers of people. Our system of government is similarly medieval&mdash;relying on a 1780s constitutional form of government written to guarantee the exploitation of the natural environment and elevate &ldquo;the endless production of more&rdquo; over the rights of people, nature, and their communities.</p>
<p>But right now, people within the community rights movement aren&rsquo;t waiting for power brokers to fix the system.

Completely circumventing (and subverting) establishment media by utilizing their own news service and freely sharing content amongst each other, the underground press, at its height, became the unifying institution for the counterculture of the 1960s. </p>
<p>Frustrated with the lack of any mainstream media criticism of the Vietnam War, empowered by the victories of the Civil Rights era, emboldened by the anti-colonial movements in the third world and with heads full of acid, a generation set out to change the world. The underground press was there documenting, participating in, and providing the resources that would guarantee the growth of this emergent youth culture. Combining bold visuals, innovative layouts, and eschewing any pretense toward objectivity, the newspapers were wildly diverse and wonderfully vibrant. </p>

The book argues that one of punk&rsquo;s most significant political achievements was to expose the operations of power in the British entertainment industries as they were thrown into confusion by the sound and the fury of musicians and fans.</p>
<p>Through a detailed examination of the conditions under which punk emerged and then declined, Dave Laing develops a view of the music as both complex and contradictory. Special attention is paid to the relationship between punk and the music industry of the late 1970s, in particular the political economy of the independent record companies through which much of punk was distributed. The rise of punk is also linked to the febrile political atmosphere of Britain in the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>Using examples from a wide range of bands, individual chapters use the techniques of semiology to consider the radical approach to naming in punk (from Johnny Rotten to Poly Styrene), the instrumental and vocal sound of the music, and its visual images. Another section analyses the influence of British punk in Europe prior to the music&rsquo;s division into &ldquo;real punk&rdquo; and &ldquo;post-punk&rdquo; genres.</p>
<p>The concluding chapter critically examines various theoretical explanations of the punk phenomenon, including the class origins of its protagonists and the influential view that punk represented the latest in a line of British youth &ldquo;subcultures.&rdquo; There is also a chronology of the punk era, plus discographies and a bibliography.</p>"

How do political activists build power and critical analysis in their daily work for change?</p>
<p>Grounded in struggles in Canada, the United States, Aotearoa/New Zealand, as well as transnational activist networks, <em>Organize! Building from the Local for Global Justice</em> links local organizing with global struggles to make a better world. In over twenty chapters written by a diverse range of organizers, activists, academics, lawyers, artists, and researchers, this book weaves a rich and varied tapestry of dynamic strategies for struggle. From community-based labor organizing strategies among immigrant workers to mobilizing psychiatric survivors, from arts and activism for Palestine to organizing in support of Indigenous Peoples, the authors reflect critically on the tensions, problems, limits, and gains inherent in a diverse range of organizing contexts and practices. The book also places these processes in historical perspective, encouraging us to use history to shed light on contemporary injustices and how they can be overcome. Written in accessible language, <em>Organize!</em> will appeal to college and university students, activists, organizers and the wider public.</p>

This booklet weaves together stories, analysis, organizing tools, and provocative questions, to offer a snapshot of the North American Climate Justice movement and provide pathways for readers to participate in it. Authors share hard lessons learned, reflect on strategy, and grapple with the challenges of their roles as organizers who do not come from &ldquo;frontline communities&rdquo; but work to build a movement big enough for everyone and led by the priorities and solutions of low-income people, communities of color, Indigenous, youth, and other constituencies most directly impacted by the crisis. Rooted in the authors&rsquo; experiences organizing in local, national, and international arenas, they challenge readers to look at the scale of ecological collapse with open eyes, without falling prey to disempowering doomsday narratives. This booklet is for anyone who wants to build a movement with the resiliency to navigate one of the most rapid transitions in human history.</p>"

A decorated Viet Nam veteran and well-respected community activist, L&oacute;pez Rivera now holds the distinction of being one of the longest held political prisoners in the world. Behind bars since 1981, L&oacute;pez Rivera was convicted of the thought-crime of &ldquo;seditious conspiracy,&rdquo; and never accused of causing anyone harm or of taking a life. This book is a unique introduction to his story and struggle, based on letters between him and the renowned lawyer, sociologist, educator, and activist Luis Nieves Falc&oacute;n.</p>
<p>In photographs, reproductions of his paintings, and graphic content, Oscar&rsquo;s life is made strikingly accessible&mdash;so all can understand why this man has been deemed dangerous to the U.S. government. His ongoing fight for freedom, for his people and for himself (his release date is 2027, when he will be 84 years old), is detailed in chapters which share the life of a Latino child growing up in the small towns of Puerto Rico and the big cities of the U.S. It tells of his emergence as a community activist, of his life underground, and of his years in prison. Most importantly, it points the way forward.</p>
<p>With a vivid assessment of the ongoing colonial relationship between the U.S. and Puerto Rico, it provides tools for working for L&oacute;pez Rivera&rsquo;s release&mdash;an essential ingredient if U.S.-Latin American relations, both domestically and internationally, have any chance of improvement. <em>Between Torture and Resistance</em> tells a sad tale of human rights abuses in the U.S. which are largely unreported. But it is also a story of hope&mdash;that there is beauty and strength in resistance.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In spite of the fact that here the silence from outside is more painful than the solitude inside the cave, the song of a bird or the sound of a cicada always reaches me to awaken my faith and keep me going.&rdquo; &mdash;Oscar L&oacute;pez Rivera</em></p>"

<p>Weaving new interviews, historical research, and the author&rsquo;s personal story as a longstanding co-op member, the book captures the excitement of a growing radical social movement along with the struggles, heartbreaking defeats, and eventual resurgence of today&rsquo;s thriving network of Bay Area cooperatives, the greatest concentration of co-ops anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>Integral to the early natural foods movement, with a radical vision of &ldquo;Food for People, Not for Profit,&rdquo; the People&rsquo;s Food System challenged agribusiness and supermarkets, and quickly grew into a powerful local network with nationwide influence before flaming out, often in dramatic fashion. <em>Other Avenues Are Possible</em> documents how food co-ops sprouted from grassroots organizations with a growing political awareness of global environmental dilapidation and unequal distribution of healthy foods to proactively serve their local communities. The book explores both the surviving businesses and a new network of support organizations that is currently expanding.</p>"

This work goes on almost unnoticed everywhere, in every culture. It is not prioritized economically, politically, or socially, and women are discriminated against and impoverished for doing it.</p>

<p>This much-anticipated follow-up to her first anthology, <em>Sex, Race, and Class</em>, compiles several decades of James&rsquo;s work with a focus on more recent writings, including a groundbreaking analysis of two of CLR James&rsquo;s masterpieces, <em>The Black Jacobins</em> and <em>Beyond a Boundary</em>, and an account of her formative partnership with him. Her experience in the movement for Caribbean federation and independence is reflected in her introduction to Ujamaa, the socialism that Tanzanian villagers built, and in her work with Guyana, Haiti, and Venezuela.</p>

<p>Steeped in the tradition of Marx urging the need for a &ldquo;practical movement,&rdquo; James recounts the unusual history of how autonomous organizations formed within the International Wages for Housework Campaign and reshaped it. Women of colour, queer women, sex workers, women with disabilities &hellip; each independent but mutually accountable (including to the men&rsquo;s network with whom they work) as they confront sexism, racism, deportation, rape, and other violence.</p>

<p>James makes the powerful argument that the struggle for climate justice can draw on all the movements people have formed to refuse exploitation and to end the capitalist hierarchy that is destroying the world.</p>

<p>There is one continuum between the care and protection of people and of the planet. The care income she campaigns for prioritizes both. Our time is now.</p>"

Elmore,,,,,,,,,,,24.95,"<p>Contemporary educational practices and policies across the world are heeding the calls of Wall Street for more corporate control, privatization, and standardized accountability. There are definite shifts and movements towards more capitalist interventions of efficiency and an adherence to market fundamentalist values within the sphere of public education. In many cases, educational policies are created to uphold and serve particular social, political, and economic ends. Schools, in a sense, have been tools to reproduce hierarchical, authoritarian, and hyper-individualistic models of social order. From the industrial era to our recent expansion of the knowledge economy, education has been at the forefront of manufacturing and exploiting particular populations within our society.</p>
<p>The important news is that emancipatory educational practices are emerging. Many are emanating outside the constraints of our dominant institutions and are influenced by more participatory and collective actions. In many cases, these alternatives have been undervalued or even excluded within the educational research. From an international perspective, some of these radical informal learning spaces are seen as a threat by many failed states and corporate entities.</p>
<p><em>Out of the Ruins</em> sets out to explore and discuss the emergence of alternative learning spaces that directly challenge the pairing of public education with particular dominant capitalist and statist structures. The authors construct philosophical, political, economic and social arguments that focus on radical informal learning as a way to contest efforts to commodify and privatize our everyday educational experiences. The major themes include the politics of learning in our formal settings, constructing new theories on our informal practices, collective examples of how radical informal learning practices and experiences operate, and how individuals and collectives struggle to share these narratives within and outside of institutions.</p>

<p>In 1887, Cl&eacute;ment Duval joined the tens of thousands of convicts sent to the &ldquo;dry guillotine&rdquo; of the French penal colonies. Few survived and fewer were able to tell the stories of their life in that hell. Duval spent fourteen years doing hard labor&mdash;espousing the values of anarchism and demonstrating the ideals by being a living example the entire time&mdash;before making his daring escape and arriving in New York City, welcomed by the Italian and French anarchists there. </p>
<p>This is much more than an historical document about the anarchist movement and the penal colony. It is a remarkable story of survival by one man&rsquo;s self-determination, energy, courage, loyalty, and hope. It was thanks to being true and faithful to his ideals that Duval survived life in this hell. Unlike the well-known prisoner Papillon, who arrived and dramatically escaped soon after Duval, he encouraged his fellow prisoners to practice mutual aid, through their deeds and not just their words. It is a call to action for mindful, conscious people to fight for their rights to the very end, to never give up or give in. </p>
<p>More than just a story of a life or a testament of ideals, here is a monument to the human spirit and a war cry for freedom and justice.</p>"

Originally written during the mid-1980s, the seminal essay &ldquo;Pacifism as Pathology&rdquo; was prompted by veteran activist Ward Churchill&rsquo;s frustration with what he diagnosed as a growing&mdash;and deliberately self-neutralizing&mdash;&rdquo;hegemony of nonviolence&rdquo; on the North American left. The essay&rsquo;s publication unleashed a raging debate among activists in both the U.S. and Canada, a significant result of which was Michael Ryan&rsquo;s penning of a follow-up essay reinforcing Churchill&rsquo;s premise that nonviolence, at least as the term is popularly employed by white &ldquo;progressives,&rdquo; is inherently counterrevolutionary, adding up to little more than a manifestation of its proponents&rsquo; desire to maintain their relatively high degrees of socioeconomic privilege and thereby serving to stabilize rather than transform the prevailing relations of power.</p>
<p>This short book challenges the pacifist movement&rsquo;s heralded victories&mdash;Gandhi in India, 1960s antiwar activists, even Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s civil rights movement&mdash;suggesting that their success was in spite of, rather than because of, their nonviolent tactics. Churchill also examines the Jewish Holocaust, pointing out that the overwhelming response of Jews was nonviolent, but that when they did use violence they succeeded in inflicting significant damage to the nazi war machine and saving countless lives.</p>
<p>As relevant today as when they first appeared, Churchill&rsquo;s and Ryan&rsquo;s trailblazing efforts were first published together in book form in 1998. Now, along with the preface to that volume by former participant in armed struggle/political prisoner Ed Mead, postscripts by both Churchill and Ryan, and a powerful new foreword by leading oppositionist intellectual Dylan Rodr&iacute;guez, these vitally important essays are being released in a fresh edition.</p>"

Activist-author Bas Umali proves with stunning evidence that these ideas are still alive in a country that he would like to see replaced by an &ldquo;archepelagic confederation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Pangayaw and Decolonizing Resistance: Anarchism in the Philippines</em> is the first-ever book specifically about anarchism in the Philippines. <em>Pangayaw</em> refers to indigenous ways of maritime warfare. Bas Umali expertly ties traditional forms of communal life in the archipelago that makes up the Philippine state together with modern-day expressions of antiauthoritarian politics. Umali&rsquo;s essays are deliciously provocative, not just for apologists of the current system, but also for radicals in the Global North who often forget that their political models do not necessarily fit the realities of postcolonial countries.</p>
<p>In weaving together independent research and experiences from grassroots organizing, Umali sketches a way for resistance in the Global South that does not rely on Marxist determinism and Maoist people&rsquo;s armies but the self-empowerment of the masses. His book addresses the crucial questions of liberation: who are the agents and what are the means?</p>
<p>More than a sterile case study, <em>Pangayaw and Decolonizing Resistance</em> is the start of a new paradigm and a must-read for those interested in decolonization, anarchism, and social movements of the Global South.</p>"

A child develops best in an environment where creativity and discovery are unimpeded by the artificial restrictions of blind faith and dogmatic belief.<em>Parenting without God</em> is for parents, and future parents, who lack belief in a god and are seeking guidance on raising freethinkers and social-justice-aware children in a nation where public dialogue has been controlled by the Christian Right.</p>
<p>Dan Arel, activist and critically acclaimed author, has penned a magnificently practical guide to help parents provide their children with the intellectual tools for standing up to attempts at religious proselytism, whether by teachers, coaches, friends, or other family members. <em>Parenting without God</em> is also for the parent activist who is trying to make the world a better place for all children by first educating their own children about racism, sexism, and all forms of discrimination that serve as barriers to the fundamentals of human dignity and democracy. It&rsquo;s for parents who wish for their children to question everything and to learn how to reach their own conclusions based on verifiable evidence and reason. Above all, Arel makes the penetrating argument that parents should lead by example&mdash;both by speaking candidly about the importance of secularism and by living an openly and unabashedly secular life.</p>
<p><em>Parenting without God</em> is written with humility, compassion, and understanding. Dan Arel&rsquo;s writing conveys the unmistakable impression of a loving father dedicated to redefining the role of parenthood so that it also includes the vitally important task of nurturing every child&rsquo;s latent impulse for freedom and autonomy.</p>

9781604865028,9781604867794,Paths_toward_Utopia_9781604867794.pdf,Paths toward Utopia,Graphic Explorations of Everyday Anarchism,Author,Cindy Milstein,Illustrated by,Erik Ruin,Foreword by,Josh MacPhee,,,,,,,,,14.95,"<p>Consisting of ten collaborative picture-essays that weave Cindy Milstein&rsquo;s poetic words within Erik Ruin&rsquo;s intricate yet bold paper-cut and scratch-board images, <em>Paths toward Utopia</em> suggests some of the here-and-now practices that prefigure, however imperfectly, the self-organization that would be commonplace in an egalitarian society. The book mines what we do in our daily lives for the already-existent gems of a freer future&mdash;premised on anarchistic ethics like cooperation and direct democracy. Its pages depict everything from seemingly ordinary activities like using parks as our commons to grandiose occupations of public space that construct do-it-ourselves communities, if only temporarily, including pieces such as &ldquo;The Gift,&rdquo; &ldquo;Borrowing from the Library,&rdquo; &ldquo;Solidarity Is a Pizza,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Waking to Revolution.&rdquo; The aim is to supply hints of what it routinely would be like to live, every day, in a world created from below, where coercion and hierarchy are largely vestiges of the past.</p>
<p><em>Paths toward Utopia</em> is not a rosy-eyed stroll, though. The book retains the tensions in present-day attempts to &ldquo;model&rdquo; horizontal institutions and relationships of mutual aid under increasingly vertical, exploitative, and alienated conditions. It tries to walk the line between potholes and potential. Yet if anarchist and other autonomist efforts are to serve as a clarion call to action, they must illuminate how people qualitatively, consensually, and ecologically shape their needs as well as desires. They must offer stepping-stones toward emancipation. This can only happen through experimentation, by us all, with diverse forms of self-determination and self-governance, even if riddled with contradictions in this contemporary moment. As the title piece to this book steadfastly asserts, &ldquo;The precarious passage itself is our road map to a liberatory society.&rdquo;</p>"

Now that power has been taken away, both centralised and privatised, under the guise of &ldquo;reform.&rdquo; There is a forgotten history of the time before reform, and within it a bright horizon is visible, reachable only if educators and society at large can learn the lessons of the past.</p>
<p>Robb Johnson entered the classroom as a new teacher in the 1980s and has spent a lifetime alongside his pupils encouraging both creativity and a healthy distrust of authority. This book is both memoir and polemic, a celebration of children&rsquo;s innate desire to learn, share, cooperate, and play, as well as a critique of bureaucratic interference. Johnson details how we ended up with the contemporary mass education systems and why they continually fail to give children what they need. Combining practical experience as a teacher with detailed pedagogical knowledge, and a characteristic playful style, Johnson is both court chronicler and jester, imparting information and creatively admonishing the self-important figureheads of the reform agenda.</p>
<p>This book considers how schools and education relate to the wider society in which they are located and how they relate to the particular needs and abilities of the people who experience them. It shows that schools and education are contested spaces that need to be reclaimed from the state, and turned into places where people can grow, not up, not old, but as individuals. It offers alternative ways of running classrooms, schools, and perhaps even society.</p>"

It was the working people of Paris, who didn&rsquo;t wear breeches, the sans-culottes. In the course of the French Revolution the sans-culottes questioned the economic system, the nature of property, the role and even the legitimacy of religion, and for the first time placed class relations at the heart of a revolutionary upheaval.

It has been generating jobs, spawning new innovation, and spreading ideas that are changing lives everywhere. It boasts of being the Left Coast, the Greenest City, and the best place for workers in the USA. So what could be wrong? It may seem that the Bay Area has the best of it in Trump&rsquo;s America, but there is a dark side of success: overheated bubbles and spectacular crashes; exploding inequality and millions of underpaid workers; a boiling housing crisis, mass displacement, and severe environmental damage; a delusional tech elite and complicity with the worst in American politics.</p>

It begins with the phenomenal concentration of IT in Greater Silicon Valley, the fabulous economic growth of the bay region and the unbelievable wealth piling up for the 1% and high incomes of Upper Classes&mdash;in contrast to the fate of the working class and people of color earning poverty wages and struggling to keep their heads above water. The middle chapters survey the urban scene, including the greatest housing bubble in the United States, a metropolis exploding in every direction, and a geography turned inside out. Lastly, it hits the environmental impact of the boom, the fantastical ideology of TechWorld, and the political implications of the tech-led transformation of the bay region.</p>"

McHarg tells of a corrupt and brutal Spanish regime, bent on bringing a rebellious working class back under its heel, and the generous and recklessly idealistic men and women who struggled to transform it after rejecting traditional party politics.</p>

Liberals have objected to sport being used for political propaganda, and leftists have decried its role in distracting the masses from the class struggle. Yet, since the beginning of organized sports, athletes, fans, and officials have tried to administer and play it in ways that strengthen, rather than hinder, progressive social change. From the workers' sports movement in the early twentieth century to the civil rights struggle transforming sports in the 1960s to the current global network of grassroots sports clubs, there has been a growing desire to include sports in the struggle for liberation and social justice. It is a struggle that has produced larger-than-life figures like Muhammad Ali and iconic images such as the Black Power salute by Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. It is also a struggle that has seen sport fans in increasing number reclaiming the games they love from undemocratic associations, greedy owners, and corporate interests.</p>

<p> The collapse of statist projects from the 1970s fostered both neo-liberalism and a global crisis of left and working-class politics. But it also opened space for rediscovering democratic, society-centered and anti-capitalist modes of bottom-up change, operating at a distance from the state. This resurgent alternative has influenced the Zapatistas in Mexico, Rojava in Syria, Occupy, and independent unions and struggles worldwide around austerity, land, and the city. Its lineages include anarchism, syndicalism, autonomist Marxism, philosophers like Alain Badiou, and popular praxis.</p>
<p>This pathbreaking volume helps recover this once sidelined politics, with a focus on South Africa and Zimbabwe. It includes a dossier of texts from a century of anarchists, syndicalists, radical unionists, and anti-apartheid activists in South Africa.

What started as a military coup turned into a profound attempt at social change from the bottom up and became headlines on a daily basis in the world media. This was due to the intensity of the struggle as well as the fact that in 1974&ndash;75 the right-wing moribund Francoist regime was still in power in neighboring Spain and there was huge uncertainty as to how these struggles might affect Spain and Europe at large.</p>
<p>This is the story of what happened in Portugal between April 25, 1974, and November 25, 1975, as seen and felt by a deeply committed participant. It depicts the hopes, the tremendous enthusiasm, the boundless energy, the total commitment, the released power, even the revolutionary innocence of thousands of ordinary people taking a hand in the remolding of their lives. And it does so against the background of an economic and social reality which placed limits on what could be done.</p>"

<p><em>Prison Round Trip</em> was first published in German in 2003 as &ldquo;Einmal Knast und zur&uuml;ck.&rdquo; The essay&rsquo;s author, Klaus Viehmann, had been released from prison ten years earlier, after completing a 15-year sentence for his involvement in urban guerilla activities in Germany in the 1970s. The essay was subsequently reprinted in various forums. It is a reflection on prison life and on how to keep one&rsquo;s sanity and political integrity within the hostile and oppressive prison environment; &ldquo;survival strategies&rdquo; are its central theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Einmal Knast und zur&uuml;ck&rdquo; soon found an audience extending beyond Germany&rsquo;s borders.

Both of these projects have pushed the conversation around fathering beyond the safe, apolitical focus most books and websites stick to; they have not been complacent but have worked hard to create a diverse, multi-faceted space in which to grapple with the complexity of fathering.</p>
<p>Today more than ever, fatherhood demands constant improvisation, risk, and struggle. With grace and honesty and strength, <em>Rad Dad&rsquo;s</em> writers tackle all the issues that other parenting guides are afraid to touch: the brutalities, beauties, and politics of the birth experience, the challenges of parenting on an equal basis with mothers, the tests faced by transgendered and gay fathers, the emotions of sperm donation, and parental confrontations with war, violence, racism, and incarceration. <em>Rad Dad</em> is for every father out in the real world trying to parent in ways that are loving, meaningful, authentic, and ultimately revolutionary.</p>

Richards,Foreword by,Bayo Akomolafe,,,,,,,,,,,17.00,"<p>No one is immune to the byproducts of compulsory schooling and standardized testing. And while reform may be a worthy cause for some, it is not enough for countless others still trying to navigate the tyranny of what schooling has always been. <em>Raising Free People</em> argues that we need to build and work within systems truly designed for any human to learn, grow, socialize, and thrive, regardless of age, ability, background, or access to money.</p>

<p>Families and conscious organizations across the world are healing generations of school wounds by pivoting into self-directed, intentional community-building, and <em>Raising Free People</em> shows you exactly how unschooling can help facilitate this process.</p>

<p>Individual experiences influence our approach to parenting and education, so we need more than the rules, tools, and &ldquo;bad adult&rdquo; guilt trips found in so many parenting and education books. We need to reach behind our behaviors to seek and find our triggers; to examine and interrupt the ways that social issues such as colonization still wreak havoc on our ability to trust ourselves, let alone children. <em>Raising Free People</em> explores examples of the transition from school or homeschooling to unschooling, how single parents and people facing financial challenges unschool successfully, and the ways unschooling allows us to address generational trauma and unlearn the habits we mindlessly pass on to children.</p>

<p>In these detailed and unabashed stories and insights, Richards examines the ways that her relationships to blackness, decolonization, and healing work all combine to form relationships and enable community-healing strategies rooted in an unschooling practice. This is how millions of families center human connection, practice clear and honest communication, and raise children who do not grow up to feel that they narrowly survived their childhoods.</p>"

<p>Drawing on rich historical research, she maps the connections between the previous forms of enclosure that occurred with the birth of capitalism and the destruction of the commons and the &ldquo;new enclosures&rdquo; at the heart of the present phase of global capitalist accumulation. Considering the commons from a feminist perspective, this collection centers on women and reproductive work as crucial to both our economic survival and the construction of a world free from the hierarchies and divisions capital has planted in the body of the world proletariat. Federici is clear that the commons should not be understood as happy islands in a sea of exploitative relations but rather autonomous spaces from which to challenge the existing capitalist organization of life and labor.</p>"

The stories and statistical information in each comic book are thoroughly researched and documented.</p>

<p><em> Prison Town: Paying the Price</em> tells the story of how the financing and site locations of prisons affects the people of rural communities in which prison are built. It also tells the story of how mass incarceration affects people of urban communities where the majority of incarcerated people come from.</p>

<p><em> Prisoners of the War on Drugs</em> includes the history of the war on drugs, mandatory minimums, how racism creates harsher sentences for people of color, stories of how the war on drugs works against women, three strikes laws, obstacles to coming home after incarceration, and how mass incarceration destabilizes neighborhoods.</p>

It presents and extends up-to-date research into several dynamic historiographic fields, and especially the history of the anarchist and syndicalist movements and the notions of transnational militancy and informal political networks.</p>
<p>Whilst restating the relevance of transnational approaches, especially in connection with the concepts of personal networks and mediators, the book underlines the importance of other scales of analysis in capturing the complexities of anarchist militancy, due to both their centrality as a theme of reflection for militants, and their role as a level of organization. Especially crucial is the national level, which is often overlooked due to the internationalism which was so central to anarchist ideology.</p>
<p>In the context of resurgent populist nationalism across the global North, especially Europe, as well as parts of the Global South, <em>Reassessing the Transnational Turn</em> is a timely and welcome exploration focusing on the high point of the historical anarchist movement, approximately between the 1870s and 1939. In it, some of the more problematic, politically ambiguous, and underexplored relationships between anarchist movements and (trans)nationalism are interrogated by a range of historians and political scholars.</p>

Kornbluh,Preface by,Daniel Gross,Notes by,Franklin Rosemont,Introduction by,Fred Thompson,,,,,,,27.95,"<p>Welcoming women, Blacks, and immigrants long before most other unions, the Wobblies from the start were labor&rsquo;s outstanding pioneers and innovators, unionizing hundreds of thousands of workers previously regarded as &ldquo;unorganizable.&rdquo; Wobblies organized the first sit-down strike (at General Electric, Schenectady, 1906), the first major auto strike (6,000 Studebaker workers, Detroit, 1911), the first strike to shut down all three coalfields in Colorado (1927), and the first &ldquo;no-fare&rdquo; transit-workers&rsquo; job-action (Cleveland, 1944). With their imaginative, colorful, and world-famous strikes and free-speech fights, the IWW wrote many of the brightest pages in the annals of working class emancipation.</p>
<p>Wobblies also made immense and invaluable contributions to workers&rsquo; culture. All but a few of America&rsquo;s most popular labor songs are Wobbly songs. IWW cartoons have long been recognized as labor&rsquo;s finest and funniest.</p>
<p>The impact of the IWW has reverberated far beyond the ranks of organized labor. An important influence on the 1960s New Left, the Wobbly theory and practice of direct action, solidarity, and &ldquo;class-war&rdquo; humor have inspired several generations of civil rights and antiwar activists, and are a major source of ideas and inspiration for today&rsquo;s radicals. Indeed, virtually every movement seeking to &ldquo;make this planet a good place to live&rdquo; (to quote an old Wobbly slogan), has drawn on the IWW&rsquo;s incomparable experience.</p>
<p>Originally published in 1964 and long out of print, <em>Rebel Voices</em> remains by far the biggest and best source on IWW history, fiction, songs, art, and lore. This new edition includes 40 pages of additional material from the 1998 Charles H. Kerr edition from Fred Thompson and Franklin Rosemont, and a new preface by Wobbly organizer Daniel Gross. </p>"

Smith,Edited by,André Moncourt,Introduction by,Ward Churchill,,,,,,,,,34.95,"<p>The long-awaited <em>Volume 2</em> of the first-ever English-language study of the Red Army Faction&mdash;West Germany&rsquo;s most notorious urban guerillas&mdash;covers the period immediately following the organization&rsquo;s near-total decimation in 1977. This work includes the details of the guerilla&rsquo;s operations, and its communiqu&eacute;s and texts, from 1978 up until the 1984 offensive.</p>
<p>This was a period of regrouping and reorientation for the RAF, with its previous focus on freeing its prisoners replaced by an anti-NATO orientation. This was in response to the emergence of a new radical youth movement in the Federal Republic, the Autonomen, and an attempt to renew its ties to the radical left. The possibilities and perils of an armed underground organization relating to the broader movement are examined, and the RAF&rsquo;s approach is contrasted to the more fluid and flexible practice of the Revolutionary Cells. At the same time, the history of the 2nd of June Movement (2JM), an eclectic guerilla group with its roots in West Berlin, is also evaluated, especially in light of the split that led to some 2JM members officially disbanding the organization and rallying to the RAF. Finally, the RAF&rsquo;s relationship to the East German Stasi is examined, as is the abortive attempt by West Germany&rsquo;s liberal intelligentsia to defuse the armed struggle during Gerhard Baum&rsquo;s tenure as Minister of the Interior.</p>
<p><em>Dancing with Imperialism</em> will be required reading for students of the First World guerilla, those with interest in the history of European protest movements, and all who wish to understand the challenges of revolutionary struggle.</p>"

Smith,Edited by,André Moncourt,Introduction by,Bill Dunne,,,,,,,,,26.95,"<p>The first in a two-volume series, this is by far the most in-depth political history of the Red Army Faction ever made available in English.</p>
<p><em> Projectiles for the People</em> starts its story in the days following World War II, showing how American imperialism worked hand in glove with the old pro-Nazi ruling class, shaping West Germany into an authoritarian anti-communist bulwark and launching pad for its aggression against Third World nations. The volume also recounts the opposition that emerged from intellectuals, communists, independent leftists, and then&mdash;explosively&mdash;the radical student movement and countercultural revolt of the 1960s.</p>
<p>It was from this revolt that the Red Army Faction emerged, an underground organization devoted to carrying out armed attacks within the Federal Republic of Germany, in the view of establishing a tradition of illegal, guerilla resistance to imperialism and state repression. Through its bombs and manifestos the RAF confronted the state with opposition at a level many activists today might find difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>For the first time ever in English, this volume presents all of the manifestos and communiqu&eacute;s issued by the RAF between 1970 and 1977, from Andreas Baader&rsquo;s prison break, through the 1972 May Offensive and the 1975 hostage-taking in Stockholm, to the desperate, and tragic, events of the &ldquo;German Autumn&rdquo; of 1977. The RAF&rsquo;s three main manifestos&mdash;<em>The Urban Guerilla Concept</em>, <em>Serve the People</em>, and <em>Black September</em>&mdash;are included, as are important interviews with <em>Spiegel</em> and <em>le Monde Diplomatique</em>, and a number of communiqu&eacute;s and court statements explaining their actions.</p>
<p>Providing the background information that readers will require to understand the context in which these events occurred, separate thematic sections deal with the 1976 murder of Ulrike Meinhof in prison, the 1977 Stammheim murders, the extensive use of psychological operations and false-flag attacks to discredit the guerilla, the state&rsquo;s use of sensory deprivation torture and isolation wings, and the prisoners&rsquo; resistance to this, through which they inspired their own supporters and others on the left to take the plunge into revolutionary action.</p>
<p>Drawing on both mainstream and movement sources, this book is intended as a contribution to the comrades of today&mdash;and to the comrades of tomorrow&mdash;both as testimony to those who struggled before and as an explanation as to how they saw the world, why they made the choices they made, and the price they were made to pay for having done so.</p>"

Now, Kenneth Wishnia&rsquo;s dynamic Filomena Buscarsela has apprenticed herself to a New York City PI firm to put in the three years necessary to get her own PI license, which she needs to earn enough money to support herself and her daughter. Trouble is, she often agrees to take on sticky neighborhood cases pro bono&mdash;like the group of squatters restoring an abandoned building in the neighborhood&mdash;rather than handle the big-bucks clients her bosses would prefer.</p>
<p>While helping out her more &ldquo;senior&rdquo; colleagues with her own superior investigative techniques bred from years on the beat, Fil agrees to look into the disappearance of a young immigrant. Then, witnessing the arrest of a neighbor on marijuana-possession charges that nearly turns into a shoot-out with the police, Fil is roped into finding out what went wrong. Trying to balance charity cases like these with bread-and-butter cases, not to mention single motherhood, Fil is quickly in over her head dodging bullish cops, aggressive businessmen, and corrupt landlords in their working-class Queens neighborhood. </p>

Bordertowns are white-dominated towns and cities that operate according to the same political and spatial logics as all other American towns and cities. The difference is that these settlements get their name from their location at the borders of current-day reservation boundaries, which separates the territory of sovereign Native nations from lands claimed by the United States.</p>
<p>Bordertowns came into existence when the first US military forts and trading posts were strategically placed along expanding imperial frontiers to extinguish indigenous resistance and incorporate captured indigenous territories into the burgeoning nation-state. To this day, the US settler state continues to wage violence on Native life and land in these spaces out of desperation to eliminate the threat of Native presence and complete its vision of national consolidation &ldquo;from sea to shining sea.&rdquo; This explains why some of the most important Native-led rebellions in US history originated in bordertowns and why they are zones of ongoing confrontation between Native nations and their colonial occupier, the United States.</p>
<p>Despite this rich and important history of political and material struggle, little has been written about bordertowns. <em>Red Nation Rising</em> marks the first effort to tell these entangled histories and inspire a new generation of Native freedom fighters to return to bordertowns as key front lines in the long struggle for Native liberation from US colonial control. This book is a manual for navigating the extreme violence that Native people experience in reservation bordertowns and a manifesto for indigenous liberation that builds on long traditions of Native resistance to bordertown violence.</p>"

Smith,Appendix by,André Moncourt,,,,,19.95,"<p>Margrit Schiller was an early member of the Red Army Faction, the West German urban guerrilla group. In 1971 she was captured and charged with a murder she did not commit, and upon her release she returned to the underground, being captured again in early 1974. She would spend most of the 1970s in prison, enduring isolation conditions meant to break the human spirit, and participating hunger strikes and other acts of resistance along with other political prisoners from the RAF.</p>

<p>In <em>Remembering the Armed Struggle</em>, Schiller recounts the process through which she joined her generation&rsquo;s revolt in the 1960s, going from work with drug users to joining the antipsychiatry political organization the Socialist Patients&rsquo; Collective and then the RAF. She tells of how she met and worked alongside the group&rsquo;s founding members, Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Jan-Carl Raspe, Irmgard M&ouml;ller, and Holger Meins; how she learned the details of the May Offensive and other actions while in her prison cell; about the struggles to defend human dignity in the most degraded of environments, and the relationships she forged with other women in prison.</p>

<p>While many have heard of the 1971 Attica prison uprising, the August Rebellion remains relatively unknown even in activist circles. <em>Resistance Behind Bars</em> is determined to challenge and change such oversights. As it examines daily struggles against appalling prison conditions and injustices, <em>Resistance</em> documents both collective organizing and individual resistance among women incarcerated in the U.S. Emphasizing women&rsquo;s agency in resisting the conditions of their confinement through forming peer education groups, clandestinely arranging ways for children to visit mothers in distant prisons and raising public awareness about their lives, <em>Resistance</em> seeks to spark further discussion and research into the lives of incarcerated women and galvanize much-needed outside support for their struggles.</p>

Twenty-six years later, Landauer would die at the hands of reactionary soldiers who overthrew the Bavarian Council Republic, a three-week attempt to realize libertarian socialism amidst the turmoil of post-World War I Germany. It was the last chapter in the life of an activist, writer, and mystic who Paul Avrich calls &ldquo;the most influential German anarchist intellectual of the twentieth century.&rdquo;</p>

The texts cover Landauer&rsquo;s entire political biography, from his early anarchism of the 1890s to his philosophical reflections at the turn of the century, the subsequent establishment of the Socialist Bund, his tireless agitation against the war, and the final days among the revolutionaries in Munich. Additional chapters collect Landauer&rsquo;s articles on radical politics in the US and Mexico, and illustrate the scope of his writing with texts on corporate capital, language, education, and Judaism.

<p>Indeed, as Federici reveals, behind the capitalist organization of work and the contradictions inherent in &ldquo;alienated labor&rdquo; is an explosive ground zero for revolutionary practice upon which are decided the daily realities of our collective reproduction.</p>

<p>Beginning with Federici&rsquo;s organizational work in the Wages for Housework movement, the essays collected here unravel the power and politics of wide but related issues including the international restructuring of reproductive work and its effects on the sexual division of labor, the globalization of care work and sex work, the crisis of elder care, the development of affective labor, and the politics of the commons.</p>

Whereas Debord&rsquo;s masterful analysis of the new historical conditions that triggered the uprisings of the 1960s armed the revolutionaries of the time with theory, Vaneigem&rsquo;s book described their feelings of desperation directly, and armed them with &ldquo;formulations capable of firing point-blank on our enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realise,&rdquo; writes Vaneigem in his introduction, &ldquo;that I have given subjective will an easy time in this book, but let no one reproach me for this without first considering the extent to which the objective conditions of the contemporary world advance the cause of subjectivity day after day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vaneigem names and defines the alienating features of everyday life in consumer society: survival rather than life, the call to sacrifice, the cultivation of false needs, the dictatorship of the commodity, subjection to social roles, and above all the replacement of God by the Economy. And in the second part of his book, &ldquo;Reversal of Perspective,&rdquo; he explores the countervailing impulses that, in true dialectical fashion, persist within the deepest alienation: creativity, spontaneity, poetry, and the path from isolation to communication and participation.</p>
<p>For &ldquo;To desire a different life is already that life in the making.&rdquo; And &ldquo;fulfillment is expressed in the singular but conjugated in the plural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present English translation was first published by Rebel Press of London in 1983.

Oppressed mothers create a generous space for life in the face of life-threatening limits, activate a powerful vision of the future while navigating tangible concerns in the present, move beyond individual narratives of choice toward collective solutions, live for more than ourselves, and remain accountable to a future that we cannot always see. <em>Revolutionary Mothering</em> is a movement-shifting anthology committed to birthing new worlds, full of faith and hope for what we can raise up together.</p>

Why is an outlaw from fourteenth century England still a hero today, with films, festivals and songs dedicated to his living memory? </p>
<p>This book explores the mysteries, the historical evidence, and the trajectory that led to centuries of village festivals around Mayday and the green space of nature unconquered by the forces in power. Great revolutionaries including William Morris adopted Robin as hero, children&rsquo;s books offered many versions, and Robin entered modern popular culture with cheap novels, silent films and comics.</p>
<p>There, in the world of popular culture, Robin Hood continues to holds unique and secure place. The &ldquo;bad-good&rdquo; hero of pulp urban fiction of the 1840s&ndash;50s, and more important, the Western outlaw who thwarts the bankers in pulps, films, and comics, is essentially Robin Hood. So are Zorro, the Cisco Kid, and countless Robin Hood knockoff characters in various media. </p>
<p>Robin Hood has a special resonance for leftwing influences on American popular culture in Hollywood, film and television. During the 1930s&ndash;50s, future blacklist victims devised radical plots of &ldquo;people&rsquo;s outlaws,&rdquo; including anti-fascist guerilla fighters, climaxing in <em>The Adventures of Robin Hood</em>, network television 1955&ndash;58, written under cover by victims of the Blacklist, seen by more viewers than any other version of Robin Hood. </p>
<p><em>Robin Hood: People&rsquo;s Outlaw and Forest Hero</em> also features 30 pages of collages and comic art, recuperating the artistic interpretations of Robin from seven centuries, and offering new comic art as a comic-within-a book.</p>

Clark,,,,,,,,,17.95,"<p>William Godwin (1756&ndash;1836) was one of the first exponents of utilitarianism and the first modern proponent of anarchism. He was not only a radical philosopher but a pioneer in libertarian education, a founder of communist economics, and an acute and powerful novelist whose literary family included his partner, pioneering feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, and his daughter Mary Godwin (later Mary Shelley), who would go on to write <em>Frankenstein</em> and marry the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p>
<p>His long life straddled two centuries. Not only did he live at the center of radical and intellectual London during the French Revolution, he also commented on some of the most significant changes in modern history. Shaped by the Enlightenment, he became a key figure in English Romanticism.</p>
<p>This work offers for the first time a handy collection of Godwin&rsquo;s key writings in a clear and concise form, together with an assessment of his influence, a biographical sketch, and an analysis of his contribution to anarchist theory and practice. The selections are taken from all of Godwin&rsquo;s writings including his groundbreaking work during the French Revolution, <em>An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em>, and arranged by editor Peter Marshall to give a coherent account of his thought for the general reader.</p>
<p>Godwin&rsquo;s work will be of interest to all those who believe that rationality, truth, happiness, individuality, equality, and freedom are central concerns of human enquiry and endeavor.</p>"

<p><em>RUIN</em> is both bracingly timely and eerily timeless in its examination of an American state in free-fall, unsparing in its disregard for broken institutions, while shining with compassion for all who are left in their wake. Cara Hoffman’s short fictions are brutal, surreal, hilarious, and transgressive, celebrating the sharp beauty of outsiders 
and the infinitely creative ways humans muster psychic resistance under oppressive conditions. The ultimate effect of these ten interconnected stories is one of invigoration and a sense of possibilities—hope for a new world extracted from the rubble of the old.</p>"

Today our individual self-preservation depends on common preservation&mdash;cooperation to provide for our mutual survival and well-being.</p>
<p>For half a century Jeremy Brecher has been studying and participating in social movements that have created new forms of common preservation. Through entertaining storytelling and personal narrative, <em>Save the Humans?</em> provides a unique and revealing interpretation of how social movements arise and how they change the world. Brecher traces a path that leads from the sitdown strikes on the pyramids of ancient Egypt through America&rsquo;s mass strikes and labor revolts to the struggle against economic globalization to today&rsquo;s battles against climate change.</p>
<p>Weaving together personal experience, scholarly research, and historical interpretation, Jeremy Brecher shows how we can construct a &ldquo;human survival movement&rdquo; that could &ldquo;save the humans.&rdquo; He sums up the theme of this book: &ldquo;I have seen common preservation&mdash;and it works.&rdquo; For those seeking an understanding of social movements and an alternative to denial and despair, there is simply no better place to look than <em>Save the Humans?</em></p>"

Set in the days of Darwin, &ldquo;The Science of Herself&rdquo; is a marvelous hybrid of SF and historical fiction: the almost-true story of England&rsquo;s first female paleontologist who took on the Victorian old-boy establishment armed with only her own fierce intelligence&mdash;and an arsenal of dino bones.</p>

<p>Learning how to fight and/or defend yourself is not the same as promoting belligerent, anti-social behavior. While talk of non-violence is understandable and the struggle for peace has never been more essential, let's face it: The odds are that sooner or later you're going to end up in a confrontation that may escalate into physical violence. So, why not be prepared?</p>
<p><em>Self-Defense for Radicals</em> will get you off and running in the right direction. From eye gouges to groin punches&mdash;you'll find a powerful collection of tactics with which we can fight back. Interspersed with words of wisdom and guidance from Emma Goldman, Bruce Lee, Angela Davis, and even Patrick Swayze, this pocket-sized pamphlet will inspire readers to not only speak truth to power but also deliver a sharp elbow to power's jutting jaw.</p>

<p>Far from a call to arms, or a &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; manual for warfare, this volume offers histories, reflections, and questions about the role of firearms in small collective defense efforts and its place in larger efforts toward the creation of autonomy and liberation.</p>

<p>Featuring diverse perspectives from movements across the globe, <em>Setting Sights</em> includes vivid histories and personal reflections from both researchers and those who participated in community armed self-defense.

Sakai,,,,,,,,,,,,,20.00,"<p><em>Settlers</em> is a uniquely important book in the canon of the North American revolutionary left and anticolonial movements. First published in the 1980s by activists with decades of experience organizing in grassroots anticapitalist struggles against white supremacy, the book soon established itself as an essential reference point for revolutionary nationalists and dissident currents within the predominantly colonialist Marxist-Leninist and anarchist movements at that time.</p>
<p>Always controversial within the establishment Left <em>Settlers</em> uncovers centuries of collaboration between capitalism and white workers and their organizations, as well as their neocolonial allies, showing how the United States was designed from the ground up as a parasitic and genocidal entity. <em>Settlers</em> exposes the fact that America&rsquo;s white citizenry have never supported themselves but have always resorted to exploitation and theft, culminating in acts of genocide to maintain their culture and way of life. As recounted in painful detail by Sakai, the United States has been built on the theft of Indigenous lands and of Afrikan labor, on the robbery of the northern third of Mexico, the colonization of Puerto Rico, and the expropriation of the Asian working class, with each of these crimes being accompanied by violence.</p>

Her starting point was the millions of unwaged women who, working in the home and on the land, were not seen as &ldquo;workers&rdquo; and their struggles viewed as outside of the class struggle. Based on her political training in the Johnson-Forest Tendency, founded by her late husband C.L.R. James, on movement experience South and North, and on a respectful study of Marx, she redefined the working class to include sectors previously dismissed as &ldquo;marginal.&rdquo; </p>
<p>For James, the class struggle presents itself as the conflict between the reproduction and survival of the human race, and the domination of the market with its exploitation, wars, and ecological devastation. She sums up her strategy for change as &ldquo;Invest in Caring not Killing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This selection, spanning six decades, traces the development of this perspective in the course of building an international campaigning network. It includes excerpts from the classic <em>The Power of Women and the Subversion of the Community</em> which launched the &ldquo;domestic labor debate,&rdquo; the exciting &ldquo;Hookers in the House of the Lord&rdquo; which describes a church occupation by sex workers, an incisive review of the C.L.R. James masterpiece <em>The Black Jacobins</em>, a reappraisal of the novels of Jean Rhys and of the leadership of Julius Nyerere, the groundbreaking &ldquo;Marx and Feminism,&rdquo; and more. </p>
<p>The writing is lucid and without jargon. The ideas, never abstract, spring from the experience of organising, from trying to make sense of the successes and the setbacks, and from the need to find a way forward.</p>"

<p>Unwittingly he becomes involved with two expatriate Greek musicians who had self-exiled from their homeland six years before, when the military junta took power, but are now returning to create oppositional energy through the form they know best: traditional Greek poetry set to the music of a composer who’s been banned by the brutal and surreal junta. Through the force of their commitment and sacrifice, Jonas is reacquainted with the relation between the heart and the larger world.</p>
<p>Jonas is also confronted, sequentially, by two women who in very different ways bring his emotional struggles into focus. One—a Greek-Canadian searching for her father lost somewhere to the depredations of the dictatorship—who seeks to draw him in. The other—an alienated Belgian painter turning her back on a life of artistic and gender frustrations—who holds him away.</p>
<p>The novel’s lyrically evoked Greek islands are counterpoint to political terror captured with both shuddering intensity and mordant black humor. <em>Shades of Resistance</em> is that rare work of fiction that explores the relationship between the personal and the political, the heightened responses of a man trapped in a moment of history.</p>"

The online momentum sparked a grassroots movement that has subsequently inspired countless individuals to share their abortion stories in art, media, and community events all over the country, and to begin building platforms for others to do the same.</p>
<p><em>Shout Your Abortion</em> is a collection of photos, essays, and creative work inspired by the movement of the same name, a template for building new communities of healing, and a call to action. Since SYA&rsquo;s inception, people all over the country have shared stories and begun organizing in a range of ways: making art, hosting comedy shows, creating abortion-positive clothing, altering billboards, starting conversations that had never happened before. This book documents some of these projects and illuminates the individuals who have breathed life into this movement, illustrating the profound liberatory and political power of defying shame and claiming sole authorship of our experiences. With <em>Roe vs. Wade</em> on the brink of reversal, the act of shouting one&rsquo;s abortion has become explicitly radical, and <em>Shout Your Abortion</em> is needed more urgently than ever before.</p>"

<p>In the US there is a tendency to focus only on the artworks produced within our shores or from English speaking producers. <em>Signal</em> reaches beyond those bounds, bringing material produced the world over, translated from dozens of languages and collected from both the present and decades past. Though it is a full-color printed publication, <em>Signal</em> is not limited to the graphic arts. Within its pages you will find political posters and fine arts, comics and murals, street art, site-specific works, zines, art collectives, documentation of performance and articles on the often overlooked but essential role all of these have played in struggles around the world.</p>

Justice, at most levels, is something the average citizen may have little influence upon, leaving us feeling helpless and complacent. But pop music is a neglected arena where concrete change can occur&mdash;by exercising active and thoughtful choices to reject the low-hanging, omnipresent corporate fruit, we begin to rebalance the world, one engaged listener at a time.</p>
<p><em>Silenced by Sound: The Music Meritocracy Myth</em> is a powerful exploration of the challenges facing art, music, and media in the digital era. With his fifth book, producer, activist, and author Ian Brennan delves deep into his personal story to address the inequity of distribution in the arts globally. Brennan challenges music industry tycoons by skillfully demonstrating that there are millions of talented people around the world far more gifted than the superstars for whom billions of dollars are spent to promote the delusion that they have been blessed with unique genius.</p>
<p>We are invited to accompany the author on his travels, finding and recording music from some of the world&rsquo;s most marginalized peoples. In the breathtaking range of this book, our preconceived notions of art are challenged by musicians from South Sudan to Kosovo, as Brennan lucidly details his experiences recording music by the Tanzania Albinism Collective, the Zomba Prison Project, a &ldquo;witch camp&rdquo; in Ghana, the Vietnamese war veterans of Hanoi Masters, the Malawi Mouse Boys, the Canary Island whistlers, genocide survivors in both Cambodia and Rwanda, and more.</p>
<p><em>Silenced by Sound</em> is defined by muscular, terse, and poetic verse, and a nonlinear format rife with how-to tips and anecdotes. The narrative is driven and made corporeal via the author&rsquo;s ongoing field-recording chronicles, his memoir-like reveries, and the striking photographs that accompany these projects.</p>

<p>From the literary heft of Angela Carter to the searing power of Octavia Butler, <em>Sisters of the Revolution</em> gathers daring examples of speculative fiction&rsquo;s engagement with feminism. Dark, satirical stories such as Eileen Gunn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stable Strategies for Middle Management&rdquo; and the disturbing horror of James Tiptree Jr.&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Screwfly Solution&rdquo; reveal the charged intensity at work in the field. Including new, emerging voices like Nnedi Okorafor and featuring international contributions from Angelica Gorodischer and many more, <em>Sisters of the Revolution</em> seeks to expand the ideas of both contemporary fiction and feminism to new fronts.

Its visions and aims have been distorted and misunderstood, its achievements forgotten. The British anarchist movement during the years 1880&ndash;1930, while borrowing from Europe, was self-actuated and independent, with a vibrant tale all its own.</p>
<p>In <em>The Slow Burning Fuse</em>, John Quail shows a history largely obscured and rewritten following 1919 and the triumph of Leninist communism. The time has arrived to resurrect the works of the early anarchist clubs, their unsung heroes, tumultuous political activities, and searing manifestos so that a truer image of radical dissent and history can be formed. Quail&rsquo;s story of the anarchists is one of utopias created in imagination and half-realised in practice, of individual fights and movements for freedom and self-expression&mdash;a story still being written today.</p>"

<p><em>Snitch World</em> takes place in a San Francisco of menacing technology, where the old cons come up short and the crimes of the gritty night have morphed into slick capers pulled off by the glow of a smartphone.</p>
<p>Klinger hangs out at the Hawse Hole, a sordid dive even by Tenderloin standards. All he really wants is enough cash to buy a cup of coffee, some cigarettes, a bug-free hotel room. The simple act of picking a carefully targeted mark&rsquo;s pocket initiates a series of events that get stranger and more dangerous by the moment.

Its political legacy, however, remains ambiguous&mdash;often associated with self-righteous macho posturing and conservative puritanism.

<p>Since straight edge&rsquo;s origins in Washington, DC, in the early 1980s, it has been linked to radical thought and action by countless individuals, bands, and entire scenes worldwide. <em>Sober Living for the Revolution</em> traces this history.</p>

Professionalism and commercialization dominate its global image. Yet the game retains a rebellious side, maybe more so than any other sport co-opted by moneymakers and corrupt politicians. From its roots in working-class England to political protests by players and fans, and a current radical soccer underground, the notion of football as the &ldquo;people&rsquo;s game&rdquo; has been kept alive by numerous individuals, teams, and communities.</p>
<p>This book not only traces this history but also reflects on common criticisms&mdash;that soccer ferments nationalism, serves right-wing powers, and fosters competitiveness&mdash;exploring alternative perspectives and practical examples of egalitarian DIY soccer. <em>Soccer vs. the State</em> serves both as an orientation for the politically conscious football supporter and as an inspiration for those who try to pursue the love of the game away from televisions and big stadiums, bringing it to back alleys and muddy pastures.</p>

Writing from his solitary cell in İmralı Prison, &Ouml;calan offered a new and astute analysis of what is happening to the Kurdish people, the Kurdish freedom movement, and future prospects for humanity.</p>
<p><em>The Sociology of Freedom</em> is the fascinating third volume of a five-volume work titled <em>The Manifesto of the Democratic Civilization</em>. The general aim of the two earlier volumes was to clarify what power and capitalist modernity entailed. Here, &Ouml;calan presents his stunningly original thesis of the democratic civilization, based on his criticism of capitalist modernity.</p>
<p>Ambitious in scope and encyclopedic in execution, <em>The Sociology of Freedom</em> is a one-of-a-kind exploration that reveals the remarkable range of one of the Left&rsquo;s most original thinkers with topics such as existence and freedom, nature and philosophy, anarchism and ecology. &Ouml;calan goes back to the origins of human culture to present a penetrating reinterpretation of the basic problems facing the twenty-first century and an examination of their solutions. &Ouml;calan convincingly argues that industrialism, capitalism, and the nation-state cannot be conquered within the narrow confines of a socialist context.</p>
<p>Recognizing the need for more than just a critique, &Ouml;calan has advanced what is the most radical, far-reaching definition of democracy today and argues that a democratic civilization, as an alternative system, already exists but systemic power and knowledge structures, along with a perverse sectarianism, do not allow it to be seen.</p>
<p><em>The Sociology of Freedom</em> is a truly monumental work that gives profuse evidence of &Ouml;calan&rsquo;s position as one of the most influential thinkers of our day. It deserves the careful attention of anyone seriously interested in constructive thought or the future of the Left.</p>"

A member of the Black Panther Party and defendant in the infamous Panther 21 case, Balagoon went underground with the Black Liberation Army (BLA). Captured and convicted of various crimes against the State, he spent much of the 1970s in prison, escaping twice. After each escape, he went underground and resumed BLA activity.</p>
<p>Balagoon was unusual for his time in several ways. He combined anarchism with Black nationalism, he broke the rules of sexual and political conformity that surrounded him, he took up arms against the white-supremacist state&mdash;all the while never shying away from developing his own criticisms of the weaknesses within the movements. His eloquent trial statements and political writings, as much as his poetry and excerpts from his prison letters, are all testimony to a sharp and iconoclastic revolutionary who was willing to make hard choices and fully accept the consequences.</p>
<p>Balagoon was captured for the last time in December 1981, charged with participating in an armored truck expropriation in West Nyack, New York, an action in which two police officers and a money courier were killed. Convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, he died of an AIDS-related illness on December 13, 1986.</p>
<p>The first part of this book consists of contributions by those who knew or were touched by Balagoon. The second section consists of court statements and essays by Balagoon himself, including several documents that were absent from previous editions and have never been published before. The third consists of excerpts from letters Balagoon wrote from prison. A final fourth section consists of a historical essay by Akinyele Umoja and an extensive intergenerational roundtable discussion of the significance of Balagoon&rsquo;s life and thoughts today.</p>"

Drawing deeply on Staughton Lynd's experiences as a labor lawyer and activist in Youngstown, OH, and on his profound understanding of the history of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), <em>Solidarity Unionism</em> helps us begin to put not only movement but also vision back into the labor movement.</p>
<p>While many lament the decline of traditional unions, Lynd takes succor in the blossoming of rank-and-file worker organizations throughout the world that are countering rapacious capitalists and those comfortable labor leaders that think they know more about work and struggle than their own members. If we apply a new measure of workers&rsquo; power that is deeply rooted in gatherings of workers and communities, the bleak and static perspective about the sorry state of labor today becomes bright and dynamic.</p>
<p>To secure the gains of solidarity unions, Staughton has proposed parallel bodies of workers who share the principles of rank-and-file solidarity and can coordinate the activities of local workers&rsquo; assemblies. Detailed and inspiring examples include experiments in workers' self-organization across industries in steel-producing Youngstown, as well as horizontal networks of solidarity formed in a variety of U.S. cities and successful direct actions overseas.</p>
<p>This is a tradition that workers understand but labor leaders reject. After so many failures, it is time to frankly recognize that the century-old system of recognition of a single union as exclusive collective bargaining agent was fatally flawed from the beginning and doesn&rsquo;t work for most workers. If we are to live with dignity, we must collectively resist. This book is not a prescription but reveals the lived experience of working people continuously taking risks for the common good.</p>"

Lynd and Gross make the audacious argument that workers themselves on the shop floor, not outside union officials, are the real hope for labor&rsquo;s future. Utilizing the principles of solidarity unionism, any group of co-workers, like the workers at Starbucks, can start building an organization to win an independent voice at work without waiting for a traditional trade union to come and &ldquo;organize&rdquo; them. Indeed, in a leaked recording of a conference call, the nation&rsquo;s most prominent union-busting lobbyist coined a term, &ldquo;the Starbucks problem,&rdquo; as a warning to business executives about the risk of working people organizing themselves and taking direct action to improve issues at work.</p>
<p> Combining history and theory with the groundbreaking practice of the model used by Starbucks workers, Lynd and Gross make a compelling case for solidarity unionism as an effective, resilient, and deeply democratic approach to winning a voice on the job and in society.</p>"

As Connolly himself repeatedly urged, nothing can replace the power of music to raise the fighting spirit of the oppressed.</p>
<p>Giving expression to Connolly&rsquo;s internationalism, musical influences ranging from traditional Irish airs to American rhythm and blues are combined here in refreshing creativity. As for the songs themselves, nine have lyrics by Connolly, three were written about Connolly, and one, &ldquo;The Red Flag,&rdquo; was chosen by Connolly to be in the original <em>Songs of Freedom</em> songbook of 1907, subsequently becoming a classic song of Labor.

Across town, a writer named Derrick has spent his life tracking the reasons--political, psychological, spiritual--for the sadism of modern civilization. And through the grim nights, Nika, a trafficked woman, tries to survive the grinding violence of prostitution. Their lives, and the forces propelling them, are about to collide.</p>
<p>Derrick&rsquo;s current project is a book called <em>Possession</em>, which asks the ontological question of who is responsible for the culture of domination that&rsquo;s destroying the earth. Who actually benefits from a dead planet, the endgame that&rsquo;s fast approaching? What if the answer is something way bigger than humans? Meanwhile, with motivations opposite to Derrick&rsquo;s, the serial killer is asking much the same question of the women he kidnaps as his final act of possession--and Nika is next. </p>
<p>Derrick&rsquo;s metaphysical explorations suddenly take on more urgency as visions both terrifying and sacred begin to intrude, and past and future collapse without warning. All Derrick knows is Nika&rsquo;s name and her impending death. The only person who believes him is his partner Allison, a woman with both strengths and scars, whose past has led her to a commitment to justice no matter what the cost. As the visions intensify and the killer draws nearer, Derrick and Allison are compelled to act, making themselves the next targets. Derrick must learn to negotiate a world of spirits and demons, living and dead, before it&rsquo;s too late. And what hangs in the balance is not just their lives, but also the fate of life on earth. </p>
<p>With <em>Songs of the Dead</em>, Derrick Jensen has written more than a thriller. This is a story lush with rage and tenderness on its way to being a weapon.</p>"

Portraits are presented without judgment or stereotype by eliminating environmental influence with a stark white backdrop. This backdrop acts as a blank canvas, where each subject&rsquo;s personal thoughts are handwritten onto the final photographic print. With more than sixty-five portraits photographed over a period of ten years, <em>Speaking OUT</em> provides rare insight into the passions, confusions, prejudices, joys, and sorrows felt by queer youth.</p>
<p><em>Speaking OUT</em> gives a voice to an underserved group of people that are seldom heard and often silenced. The collaboration of image and first-person narrative serves to provide an outlet, show support, create dialogue, and help those who struggle. It not only shows unity within the LGBTQ community, but also commonalities regardless of age, race, gender, and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>With recent media attention and the success of initiatives such as the It Gets Better Project, resources for queer youth have grown. Still, a void exists which <em>Speaking OUT</em> directly addresses: this book is for youth, by youth.</p>
<p><em>Speaking OUT</em> is an award-winning, nationally and internationally shown and published body of work. These images have been published in magazines such as the <em>Advocate</em>, <em>School Library Journal</em>, <em>Curve</em>, <em>Girlfriends</em>, and <em>Out</em>, and showcased by the Human Rights Campaign, National Public Radio, Public Television, and the U.S. Department of Education. The work continues to show in galleries, universities, youth centers, and churches around the world.</p>"

Though not a riot grrl band, Spitboy blazed trails for women musicians in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy. Misogyny, sexism, abusive fans, class and color blindness, and all-out racism were foes, especially for Gonzales, a Xicana and the only person of color in the band.</p>
<p>Unlike touring rock bands before them, the unapologetically feminist Spitboy preferred Scrabble games between shows rather than sex and drugs, and they were not the angry manhaters that many expected them to be. Serious about women&rsquo;s issues and being the band that they themselves wanted to hear, a band that rocked as hard as men but sounded like women, Spitboy released several records and toured internationally. The memoir details these travels while chronicling Spitboy&rsquo;s successes and failures, and for Gonzales, discovering her own identity along the way.</p>
<p>Fully illustrated with rare photos and flyers from the punk rock underground, this fast-paced, first-person recollection is populated by scenesters and musical allies from the time including Econochrist, Paxston Quiggly, Neurosis, Los Crudos, Aaron Cometbus, Pete the Roadie, Green Day, Fugazi, and Kamala and the Karnivores.</p>"

<p>Formed in Hermosa Beach, California, in 1978, for eight brutal years they made and played brilliant, ugly, no-holds-barred music on a self-appointed touring circuit of America&rsquo;s clubs, squats, and community halls. They fought with everybody: the police, the record industry and even their own fans. They toured overseas on pennies a day and did it in beat-up trucks and vans.</p>
<p><em>Spray Paint the Walls</em> tells Black Flag&rsquo;s story from the inside, drawing on exclusive interviews with the group&rsquo;s members, their contemporaries, and the bands they inspired. It&rsquo;s the story of Henry Rollins, and his journey from fan to iconic frontman. And it&rsquo;s the story of Greg Ginn, who turned his electronics company into one of the world&rsquo;s most influential independent record labels while leading Black Flag from punk&rsquo;s three-chord frenzy into heavy metal and free-jazz. Featuring over 30 photos of the band from Glen E. Friedman, Edward Colver, and others.</p>"

It&rsquo;s the story of how The Clash fell in love with America, and how America loved them back. The romance began in full in 1977, when select rock journalists and deejays aided the band&rsquo;s quest to depose the rock of indolence that dominated American airwaves. This history situates The Clash amid the cultural skirmishes of the 1970s and culminates with their September 1979 performance at the Palladium in New York City. This concert was broadcast live on WNEW, and it concluded with Paul Simonon treating his Fender bass like a woodcutter&rsquo;s ax.</p>
<p>This performance produced one of the most exhilarating Clash bootleg recordings, and the photo of Simonon&rsquo;s outburst which graced the cover of the <em>London Calling</em> LP was recently deemed the greatest rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll photograph of all time. That night marked one of the last opportunities for American audiences to see The Clash as a punk band, teetering between conviction and uncertainty, before they became a seriously brilliant rock group.</p>
<p><em>Stealing</em> represents a distinctive take on the history of punk, for no other book gives proper attention to the forces of free-form radio, long-form rock journalism, or Clash bootleg recordings, many of which are now widely available on the web. This story, which takes its title from the 1981 single &ldquo;Radio Clash,&rdquo; includes original interviews with key figures from the New York punk scene. This secret history concludes with an analysis of how we listen to music today and its impact on the written word.</p>"

The impact of feminism, anticolonial struggles, wildcat industrial strikes, and antiwar agitation were all felt globally. With social strictures and political structures challenged at every level, pulp and popular fiction could hardly remain unaffected. Feminist, gay, lesbian, Black and other previously marginalised authors broke into crime, thrillers, erotica, and other paperback genres previously dominated by conservative, straight, white males. For their part, pulp hacks struck back with bizarre takes on the revolutionary times, creating fiction that echoed the Nixonian backlash and the coming conservatism of Thatcherism and Reaganism.</p>

<p><em>Sticking It to the Man</em> tracks the ways in which the changing politics and culture of the 1950s, &rsquo;60s, and &rsquo;70s were reflected in pulp and popular fiction in the United States, the UK, and Australia. Featuring more than three hundred full-color covers, the book includes in-depth author interviews, illustrated biographies, articles, and reviews from more than two dozen popular culture critics and scholars. Among the works explored, celebrated, and analysed are books by street-level hustlers turned best-selling black writers Iceberg Slim, Nathan Heard, and Donald Goines; crime heavyweights Chester Himes, Ernest Tidyman and Brian Garfield; Yippies Anita Hoffman and Ed Sanders; best-selling authors such as Alice Walker, Patricia Nell Warren, and Rita Mae Brown; and myriad lesser-known novelists ripe for rediscovery.</p>

Scarcely a society has existed on the face of the earth that has not had commoning at its heart. &ldquo;Neither the state nor the market,&rdquo; say the planetary commoners. These essays kindle the embers of memory to ignite our future commons.</p>
<p>From Thomas Paine to the Luddites, from Karl Marx&mdash;who concluded his great study of capitalism with the enclosure of commons&mdash;to the practical dreamer William Morris&mdash;who made communism into a verb and advocated communizing industry and agriculture&mdash;to the 20th-century communist historian E.P. Thompson, Linebaugh brings to life the vital commonist tradition. He traces the red thread from the great revolt of commoners in 1381 to the enclosures of Ireland, and the American commons, where European immigrants who had been expelled from their commons met the immense commons of the native peoples and the underground African-American urban commons. Illuminating these struggles in this indispensable collection, Linebaugh reignites the ancient cry, &ldquo;STOP, THIEF!&rdquo;</p>"

Not just another iconoclastic band, Crass was a musical, social, and political phenomenon. </p>

Involving nationwide general strikes, the seizure of vast industrial establishments, nonviolent direct action on a massive scale, and armed battles with artillery and tanks, this exciting hidden history is told from the point of view of the rank-and-file workers who lived it. Encompassing the repeated repression of workers&rsquo; rebellions by company-sponsored violence, local police, state militias, and the U.S. Army and National Guard, it reveals a dimension of American history rarely found in the usual high school or college history course.</p>
<p>Since its original publication in 1972, no book has done as much as <em>Strike!</em> to bring U.S. labor history to a wide audience. Now this fiftieth anniversary edition brings the story up to date with chapters covering the &ldquo;mini-revolts of the twenty-first century,&rdquo; including Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for Fifteen. The new edition contains over a hundred pages of new materials and concludes by examining a wide range of current struggles, ranging from #BlackLivesMatter, to the great wave of teachers&rsquo; strikes &ldquo;for the soul of public education,&rdquo; to the global &ldquo;Student Strike for Climate&rdquo; that may be harbingers of mass strikes to come.</p>"

<p>Berger&rsquo;s encyclopedic knowledge of American social movements provides a rich comparative history of numerous social movements that continue to shape contemporary politics. The book also offers a little-heard voice in contemporary critiques of mass incarceration. Rather than seeing the issue of America&rsquo;s prison growth as stemming solely from the war on drugs, Berger locates mass incarceration within a slew of social movements that have provided steep challenges to state power.</p>"

These essays propose a militant strategy of queer survival in an ever precarious future. Starting from a position of abolition—of prisons, police, the State, identity, and racist cisheteronormative society—this collection refuses the bribes of inclusion in a system built on our expendability. Though the mainstream media saturates us with the boring norms of queer representation (with a recent focus on trans visibility), the writers in this book ditch false hope to imagine collective visions of liberation that tell different stories, build alternate worlds, and refuse the legacies of racial capitalism, anti-Blackness, and settler colonialism. The work curated in this book spans Black queer life in the time of COVID-19 and uprising, assimilation and pinkwashing settler colonial projects, subversive and deviant forms of representation, building anarchist trans/queer infrastructures, and more.

The poems take the reader from the forbidding valleys and mountains of Waziristan in the tribal areas of Pakistan to the think tanks and halls of power in Washington, DC; from the rustic tranquility of Cambridge to the urban chaos of Karachi.</p>
<p>The collection spans half a century of writing and gives the reader a front row seat to the drama of a world in turmoil. Can there be more drama than Ahmed&rsquo;s first memories as a boy of four on a train through the killing fields of North India during the partition of the subcontinent in 1947? Or the breakup of Pakistan into two counties amidst mass violence in 1971? Yet, in the midst of change and uncertainty, there is the optimism and faith of a man with confidence in his fellow man and in the future, despite the knowledge that perhaps the problems and challenges of the changing world would prove to be too great. </p>
<p>Ahmed&rsquo;s poetry was a constant source of solace and renewal to which he escaped for inspiration and sanity. He loved poetry of every kind whether English, Urdu or Persian. Ahmed was as fascinated by Keats and Coleridge as he was by Rumi and Ghalib. For us, he serves as a guide to the inner recesses of the Muslim world showing us its very heart. Through the poems, the reader gets fresh insights into the Muslim world and its struggles. Above all, they carry the eternal message of hope and compassion.</p>"

This may seem mundane, but virtually every time, even aside from the details of the case in question, the process, the steps, the ways of linking one thing to another illustrate what it means to be a thinking, critical subject of history and society, in any time and place.</p>

<p><em>Taming the Rascal Multitude</em> is a judicious selection of essays and interviews from <em>Z Magazine</em> from 1997 to 2014. In each, Chomsky takes up some question of the moment. As such, in sum, the essays provide an historical overview of the history that preceded Trump and the reaction to Trump. The essays situate what followed even without having known what would follow. They explicate what preceded the current era and provide a step-by-step revelation or how-to for successfully comprehending social events and relations. They are a pleasure to read, much like the pleasure of watching a great athlete or performer, but they also edify. They educate.</p>

<p>Reading Chomsky is about understanding how society works, how people relate to society and social trends and patterns and why, and, beyond the specifics, how to approach events, relations, occurrences, trends, and patterns in a way that reveals their inner meanings and their outer connections and implications. It is like reading the best you can get about topic after topic, and, more, it is like watching a master-craftsmen in a discipline that ought to be all of ours understanding the world to change it.</p>"

The show of international solidarity for the people of Oaxaca was the most extensive since the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Fueled by long ignored social contradictions, what began as a teachers&rdquo; strike demanding more resources for education quickly turned into a massive movement that demanded direct, participatory democracy.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Oaxacans raised their voices against the abuses of the state government. They participated in marches of up to 800,000 people, occupied government buildings, took over radio stations, called for statewide labor and hunger strikes, held sit-ins, reclaimed spaces for public art and created altars for assassinated activists in public spaces. In the now legendary March of Pots and Pans, two thousand women peacefully took over and operated the state television channel for three weeks. Barricades that were built all over the city to prevent the passage of paramilitaries and defend occupied public spaces, quickly became a place where neighbors got to know each other, shared ideas and developed new strategies for organizing. </p>
<p>Despite the fierce repression that the movement faced&mdash;with hundreds arbitrarily detained, tortured, forced into hiding, or murdered by the state and federal forces and paramilitary death squads&mdash;people were determined to make their voices heard.</p>

Not so for me. I&rsquo;m not religious, not a Zionist, so in what consists my Jewishness? Is a love of chopped liver and a belief that chicken soup cures all ills enough? And does it matter? This is the story of my search for answers. It is an argument with myself, with song lyrics to embellish the argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like so many of those others in Britain of Jewish lineage, songwriter and award-winning folk singer Leon Rosselson is descended from antecedents who fled pogroms in eastern Europe. Pertinently, he questions what being a Jew means&mdash;is it adherence to Judaism as a religion, an ethnicity, a citizen of Israel, or someone who eats &ldquo;chicken soup with knedlach&rdquo;? He describes clearly and with historical insight how any concept of &ldquo;Jewishness&rdquo; can involve all of those things and more. In his own life, he has decided to pick and choose from this tradition and history and build on what he deems to be the progressive, humane, and universalist values of that Jewish background.</p>
<p>Rosselson is a strong supporter of Palestinian rights, seeing in the victimization of Palestinians by the state of Israel parallels with historical Jewish persecution. He concludes this short essay by stating: &ldquo;I share with the growing number of Jews in the diaspora who place solidarity with the oppressed above demands of tribalism and with those in Israel who dare to stand against the powers that be.&rdquo;</p>"

As Syria plunged into civil war, the Kurds and their Arab and Assyrian allies established a self-governing polity that was not only multiethnic but democratic. And women were not only permitted but encouraged to participate in all social roles alongside men, including political and military roles.</p>
<p>To implement these goals, Rojava wanted to live in peace with its neighbors. Instead, it soon faced invasion by ISIS, a force that was in every way its opposite. ISIS attacked its neighbors in Iraq and Syria, imposing theocratic, tyrannical, femicidal rule on them. Those who might have resisted fled in terror. But when ISIS attacked the mostly Kurdish city of Kobane and overran much of it, the YPG and YPJ, or people's militias, declined to flee. Instead they resisted, and several countries, seeing their valiant resistance, formed an international coalition to assist them militarily. While the YPG and YPJ fought on the ground, the coalition coordinated airstrikes with them. They liberated village after village and in March 2019 captured ISIS&rsquo;s last territory in Syria.</p>
<p>Around that time, two UK-based filmmakers invited the author to spend a month in Rojava making a film. She accepted, and arrived to explore the society and interview people. During that month, she explored how the revolution had progressed and especially the effects of the war on the society. She found that the war had reinforced social solidarity and welded together the multiethnic, gender-liberated society. As one man in Kobane told her, &ldquo;Our blood got mixed.&rdquo;</p>"

<p>She first went to Palestine in 2003 during the Second Intifada to support Palestinians resisting the Israeli occupation. In 2006, she became pregnant in Bethlehem, West Bank. By the time her daughter was three years old, they had already celebrated with Zapatista women in southern Mexico and survived Israeli detention, and during the 2011 Arab Spring they were in the streets of Cairo protesting the Mubarak dictatorship. She watched the Egyptian revolution fall apart and escaped the violence, like many of her Arab comrades, by moving to Europe. Three years later, she and Aza were camping at Standing Rock in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline and co-creating revolutionary mothering communities once again.</p>
<p>This is a story about mothers who are doing the work of deep social transformation by creating the networks of care that sustain movements and revolutions. By centering mothers in our organizing work, we center those who have the skills and the experience of creating and sustaining life on this planet. <em>This Is How We Survive</em> illuminates how mothering is a practice essential to the work of revolution. It explores the heartbreak of revolutionary movements falling apart and revolutionaries scattering across the globe into exile. And most importantly, how mamas create, no matter the conditions, the resilience to continue doing revolutionary work.</p>"

<p>In this world, he survives on favors and reputation as a small-time private investigator, but when a young woman hires him to solve the potential murder of the singer of one of his favorite local bands, everything in his life amps up. As he digs deeper into what really happened, Alex must both seek out and dodge an endless array of dangerously powerful drug dealers, aging porn stars, crooked cops, neo-Nazi skinheads, and shadowy, corrupt politicians. The deeper he gets—and the more punishment his body takes and the more he begins to fall for the woman who hired him—the more determined he becomes to follow the trail to its conclusion. In the end, the truth is far more complicated than Alex had thought: not only about the murder and the victim’s unsavory private life but also about Alex’s own past behaviors and attitudes. </p>
<p>Meticulously researched and drawing from memoirs, zines, and documentaries, Alex Damage’s story comes to life with real hangouts and real shows from LA in 1981, which makes the book immersive for the people who were there as well as those who wish they could have been. </p>"

Introducing the main protagonists to the debate, this previously untold story follows the polemical twists and turns that ensued in the volatile atmosphere of the 1960s and &rsquo;70s. The picture that emerges is of a struggle for dominance between Soviet-derived approaches and a uniquely Cuban response to the arts under socialism. The latter tendency, which eventually won out, was based on the principles of Marxist humanism. As such, this book foregrounds emancipatory understandings of culture.</p>
<p><em>To Defend the Revolution Is to Defend Culture</em> takes its title from a slogan &ndash; devised by artists and writers at a meeting in October 1960 and adopted by the First National Congress of Writers and Artists the following August &ndash; which sought to highlight the intrinsic importance of culture to the Revolution. Departing from popular top-down conceptions of Cuban policy-formation, this book establishes the close involvement of the Cuban people in cultural processes and the contribution of Cuba&rsquo;s artists and writers to the policy and praxis of the Revolution. Ample space is dedicated to discussions that remain hugely pertinent to those working in the cultural field, such as the relationship between art and ideology, engagement and autonomy, form and content. As the capitalist world struggles to articulate the value of the arts in anything other than economic terms, this book provides us with an entirely different way of thinking about culture and the policies underlying it.</p>"

Chris Crass&rsquo;s collection of essays and interviews presents us with powerful lessons for transformative organizing through offering a firsthand look at the challenges and the opportunities of anti-racist work in white communities, feminist work with men, and bringing women of color feminism into the heart of social movements. Drawing on two decades of personal activist experience and case studies of anti-racist social justice organizations, Crass insightfully explores ways of transforming divisions of race, class, and gender into catalysts for powerful vision, strategy, and movement building in the United States today.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades, activists in the United States have been experimenting with new politics and organizational approaches that stem from a fusion of radical political traditions and liberation struggles. Drawing inspiration from women of color feminism, justice struggles in communities of color, anarchist and socialist movements, the broad upsurges of the 1960s and 70s, and social movements in the Global South, a new generation of activists has sought to understand the past while building a movement for today&rsquo;s world. <em>Towards Collective Liberation</em> contributes to this project by examining two primary dynamic trends in these efforts: the anarchist movement of the 1990s and 2000s, through which tens of thousands of activists were introduced to radical politics, direct action organizing, democratic decision making, and the profound challenges of taking on systems of oppression, privilege, and power in society at large and in the movement itself; and white anti-racist organizing efforts from the 2000s to the present as part of a larger strategy to build broad-based, effective multiracial movements in the United States.</p>
<p>Crass&rsquo;s collection begins with an overview of the anarchist tradition as it relates to contemporary activism and an in-depth look at Food Not Bombs, one of the leading anarchist groups in the revitalized radical Left in the 1990s. The second and third sections of the book combine stories and lessons from Crass&rsquo;s experiences of working as an anti-racist and feminist organizer, combining insights from the Civil Rights Movement, women of color feminism, and anarchism to address questions of leadership, organization building, and revolutionary strategy. In section four, Crass discusses how contemporary organizations have responded to the need for white activists to lead anti-racist efforts in white communities and how these efforts have contributed to multiracial alliances in building a broad-based movement for collective liberation. Offering rich case studies of successful organizing, and grounded, thoughtful key lessons for movement building, <em>Toward Collective Liberation</em> is a must-read for anyone working for a better world.</p>"

Traffic is not only an ecological and social problem but also a political one. Modern traffic reproduces the rule of the state and capital and is closely linked to class society. It is a problem of power. At its core lies the notion of &ldquo;automobility,&rdquo; a contradictory ideal of free movement closely linked to a tight web of regulations and control mechanisms. This is the main thesis of the manifesto <em>The Traffic Power Structure</em>, penned by the Sweden-based activist network Planka.nu.</p>
<p>Planka.nu was founded in 2001 to fight for free public transport. Thanks to creative direct action, witty public interventions, and thought-provoking statements, the network has become a leading voice in Scandinavian debates on traffic. In its manifesto, Planka.nu presents a critique of the automobile society, analyzes the connections between traffic, the environment, and class, and outlines its political vision. The topics explored along the way include Bruce Springsteen, high-speed trains, nuclear power, the security-industrial complex, happiness research, and volcano eruptions. Planka.nu rejects demands to travel ever-longer distances in order to satisfy our most basic needs while we lose all sense for proximity and community. <em>The Traffic Power Structure</em> argues for a different kind of traffic in a different kind of world.</p>
<p>The book has received several awards in Sweden and has been hailed by Swedish media as a &ldquo;manifesto of striking analytical depth, based on profound knowledge and a will to agitation that demands our respect&rdquo; (<em>Ny Tid</em>).</p>"

<p>To function in this society, we are asked to live by lies: that humans have the right to take what they want from the earth without giving back, that knowledge is limited to that which can be quantified, that corporations and governments know what is best for our future. Our instinctive outrage at environmental collapse, political conspiracy, and corporate corruption is stifled by the double-speak of popular opinion telling us that the &ldquo;progress&rdquo; of civilization demands unquestioning allegiance to those in power. But the brave voices in <em>Truths Among Us</em> seek to help us acknowledge the values we know in our hearts are right&mdash;and inspire within us the courage to act on them.</p>
<p>Among those who share their wisdom here is acclaimed sociologist Stanley Aronowitz, who shows us that science is but one lens through which we can discover knowledge. Luis Rodriguez, poet and peacemaker, asks us to embrace gang members as people instead of stereotypes, while the brilliant Judith Herman helps us gain a deeper understanding of the psychology of abusers in whatever form they may take. Paul Stamets reveals the power of fungi, whose intelligence, like that of so many nonhumans, is often ignored. And writer Richard Drinnon reminds us that our spiritual paths need not be narrowed by the limiting mythologies of Western civilization.</p>
<p>Following <em>How Shall I Live My Life?</em> and <em>Resistance Against Empire</em>, Jensen's third collection of interviews reinforces a simple premise with which he has long challenged his readers: if we shut our ears and eyes to the cacophony of consumption-oriented distractions and pause to listen to the wisdom of our own hearts, the truths among us will reveal themselves.</p>

It is also where, in May 1989, the police discovered an apartment that had served Denmark&rsquo;s most notorious twentieth-century bank robbers as a hideaway for years. The Blekingegade Group members belonged to a communist organization and lived modest lives in the Danish capital. Over a period of almost two decades, they sent millions of dollars acquired in spectacular heists to Third World liberation movements, in particular the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). In May 1991, seven of them were convicted and went to prison.</p>
<p>The story of the Blekingegade Group is one of the most puzzling and captivating chapters from the European anti-imperialist milieu of the 1970s and &rsquo;80s. <em>Turning Money into Rebellion: The Unlikely Story of Denmark&rsquo;s Revolutionary Bank Robbers</em> is the first-ever account of the story in English, covering a fascinating journey from anti-war demonstrations in the late 1960s via travels to Middle Eastern capitals and African refugee camps to the group&rsquo;s fateful last robbery that earned them a record haul and left a police officer dead.</p>
<p>The book includes historical documents, illustrations, and an exclusive interview with Torkil Lauesen and Jan Weimann, two of the group&rsquo;s longest-standing members. It is a compelling tale of turning radical theory into action and concerns analysis and strategy as much as morality and political practice. Perhaps most importantly, it revolves around the cardinal question of revolutionary politics: What to do, and how to do it?</p>"

Most young Americans have little or no knowledge about restrictive covenants, literacy tests, poll taxes, lynchings, and other oppressive features of the Jim Crow racial hierarchy. Even those who have some familiarity with the period may initially view racist segregation and injustices as mere relics of a distant, shameful past. A proper understanding of race relations in this country must include a solid knowledge of Jim Crow&mdash;how it emerged, what it was like, how it ended, and its impact on the culture.</p>
<p><em>Understanding Jim Crow</em> introduces readers to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, a collection of more than ten thousand contemptible collectibles that are used to engage visitors in intense and intelligent discussions about race, race relations, and racism. The items are offensive. They were meant to be offensive. The items in the Jim Crow Museum served to dehumanize blacks and legitimized patterns of prejudice, discrimination, and segregation.</p>
<p>Using racist objects as teaching tools seems counterintuitive&mdash;and, quite frankly, needlessly risky. Many Americans are already apprehensive discussing race relations, especially in settings where their ideas are challenged. The museum and this book exist to help overcome our collective trepidation and reluctance to talk about race.</p>
<p>Fully illustrated, and with context provided by the museum&rsquo;s founder and director David Pilgrim, <em>Understanding Jim Crow</em> is both a grisly tour through America&rsquo;s past and an auspicious starting point for racial understanding and healing.</p>"

Smith,,,,,,,,,,,20.00,"<p>Over the past decade, Canada has experienced considerable growth in labour migration. Moreover, temporary labour migration has replaced permanent immigration as the primary means by which people enter Canada. Utilizing the rhetoric of maintaining competitiveness, Canadian employers and the state have ushered in an era of neoliberal migration alongside an agenda of austerity flowing from capitalist crisis. Labour markets have been restructured to render labour more flexible and precarious, and in Canada as in other high-income capitalist labour markets, employers are relying on migrant and immigrant workers as &ldquo;unfree labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This book explores labour migration to Canada and how public policies of temporary and guest worker programs function in the global context of work and capitalist restructuring. Contributors are directly engaged with the issues emerging from the influx of temporary foreign workers and Canada&rsquo;s &ldquo;creeping economic apartheid&rdquo;&mdash;the ongoing racialization of economic inequality for many workers of colour. The collection also examines how migrant and immigrant workers have organized for justice and dignity in Canada. As opposed to a good deal of current writing that often ignores the working conditions and struggles of racialized migrant and immigrant workers, the authors contend that migrant workers, labour organizations, and migrant worker allies have engaged in a wide range of organizing initiatives with significant political and economic impacts. These have included both court challenges to secure legal rights to unionization and grassroots alternatives to traditional forms of unionization through workers&rsquo; centres.</p>

<p>Significant attention is given to what the author describes as &ldquo;struggles for the real Social Revolution&rdquo;; that is, the uprising of the sailors and workers of Kronstadt in 1921, and the peasant movement that Nestor Makhno led in Ukraine. These movements, which sought to defend the social revolution from destruction by the politicians, provide important material for a clearer understanding of both the original objectives of the Russian Revolution and the problems with which all revolutions with far-reaching social objectives have to contend.</p>
<p>Drawing on the revolutionary press of the time, Voline reveals the deep cleavage between the objectives of the libertarians and those of the Bolsheviks, differences which the latter &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; by ruthlessly eliminating all who stood in their way in the struggle for power.</p>

These movements have galvanized long-silent&mdash;or silenced&mdash;sectors of society: indigenous people, campesinos, students, the LGBT community, the unemployed, and all those left out of the promised utopia of a globalized economy. They have deployed a wide range of strategies and actions, sometimes building schools or clinics, sometimes occupying factories or fields, sometimes building and occupying political parties to take the reins of the state, and sometimes resisting government policies in order to protect their newfound power in community.</p>
<p>This unique collection of interviews features five dozen leaders and grassroots activists from fifteen countries presenting their work and debating pressing questions of power, organizational forms, and relations with the state. They have mobilized on a wide range of issues: fighting against mines and agribusiness and for living space, rural and urban; for social space won through recognition of language, culture, and equal participation; for community and environmental survival. The book is organized in chapters by country with each chapter introduced by a solidarity activist, writer, or academic with deep knowledge of the place. This indispensable compilation of primary source material gives participants, students, and observers of social movements a chance to learn from their experience.</p>

Loewen also returns to his life&rsquo;s work and gently addresses the origins of racism and inequality, the theory of history, and the ties between the two.

In service to annual grains, humans have devastated prairies and forests, driven countless species extinct, altered the climate, and destroyed the topsoil--the basis of life itself.

Scruggs,,,,,,,,,,,6.95,"<p>When the socialist politician Salvador Allende dramatically won Chile&rsquo;s presidential election in 1970, a powerful cultural movement accompanied him to power. Folk singers emerged at the forefront, proving that music could help forge the birth of a new society. As the CIA actively funded opposition media against Allende during his campaign, the New Chilean Song Movement rose to prominence, viscerally persuading voters with its music. V&iacute;ctor Jara, a central protagonist at the time, became an icon in Chile, Latin America, and beyond for his revolutionary lyrics and life. Inti-Illimani, Quilapay&uacute;n, and other musicians contributed by singing before audiences of workers outside factories or <em>campesinos</em> in Chile&rsquo;s rural countryside.</p>
<p>A short cultural history, <em>&ldquo;Venceremos&ldquo;</em>  charts the development of the movement from the years before Allende&rsquo;s victorious campaign to the brutal U.S.-backed military coup on September 11, 1973, that overthrew his presidency and imposed the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. Featuring interviews from key figures and lyrical analysis, <em>&ldquo;Venceremos&ldquo;</em>  gives insight into how the New Chilean Song Movement&rsquo;s revolutionary anthems came to be.</p>
<p>From the early folkloric documentation of Violeta Parra in Chile&rsquo;s countryside to &ldquo;Venceremos,&ldquo; the triumphant anthem of Allende&rsquo;s Popular Unity Coalition, the music of Chile&rsquo;s Nueva Canci&oacute;n was shaped by the larger history occurring all around it. Within the songs, all the hopes, dreams and apprehensions of the nation were reflected. At the same time, as its influence grew, the cultural movement claimed its own principal space as catalyst of not only Chile&rsquo;s musical but its political future as well. So dangerous were its creations that the Pinochet dictatorship censored and attempted to destroy them. Most tragically, V&iacute;ctor Jara&rsquo;s life was taken in the bloody repression that immediately followed the coup. </p>"

<p>Born in Ukraine on the first day of the century, a Jewish antisemite, Pyat careered through three decades like a runaway train. Bisexual, cocaine-loving engineer/inventor/spy, he enthusiastically embraces Fascism. Hero-worshipping Mussolini, he enters the dictator&rsquo;s circle, enjoys a close friendship with Mussolini&rsquo;s wife and is sent by the Duce on a secret mission to Munich, becoming intimate with Ernst R&ouml;hm, the homosexual stormtrooper leader. His crucial role in the Nazi Party&rsquo;s struggle for power has him performing perverted sex acts with &ldquo;Alf,&rdquo; as the F&uuml;hrer&rsquo;s friends call him.</p>

The &ldquo;hidden history&rdquo; announced in the book&rsquo;s title begins with analysis of Harvard&rsquo;s involvement in the Salem witch trials and the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti. Similarly disquieting, Harvard provided students as strikebreakers in both the 1912 Bread and Roses textile workers strike and the 1919 Boston police strike. Harvard administrators and scientists promoted eugenics in the early twentieth century and had a deep impact on Nazi Germany&rsquo;s race theories. Its contemporary ties to U.S. foreign policy and neoliberalism are also profound. Harvard&rsquo;s management of Russian economic reform left nightmarish memories, and the university was compelled to pay more than $26 million after the U.S. government sued it. The book also examines Harvard&rsquo;s investment policy for its massive endowment, its restrictive labor policies, and its devastation of the adjoining Allston-Brighton neighborhood into which it is expanding.</p>
<p>Harvard&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;Veritas,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in Latin. As the author reviews Harvard&rsquo;s history, she questions the real meaning of truth and changes the letter &ldquo;s&rdquo; to &ldquo;$&rdquo; to emphasize the ways that Harvard has pursued money and power above its quest for truth.</p>
<p>In directing her award-winning DVD of the same name and in preparing this book, the author used documents and interviews with dozens of people, including Noam Chomsky, George Katsiaficas, Richard Levins, Margaret Gullette, Victor Wallis, and many more.</p>"

At the center of the novel stands Vida Asch. She has lived underground for almost a decade. Back in the &rsquo;60s she was a political star of the exuberant antiwar movement&mdash;a red-haired beauty photographed for the pages of <em>Life</em> magazine&mdash;charismatic, passionate, and totally sure she would prevail. Now, a decade later, Vida is on the run, her star-quality replaced by stubborn courage. She comes briefly to rest in a safe house on Cape Cod. To her surprise and annoyance, she finds another person in the house, a fugitive, Joel, ten years younger than she, a kid who dropped into the underground out of the army. As they spend the next days together, Vida finds herself warming toward a man for the first time in years, knowing the dangers all too well.</p>
<p>As counterpoint to the underground &rsquo;70s, Marge Piercy tells the extraordinary tale of the optimistic &rsquo;60s, the thousands of people who were members of SAW (Students Against the War) and of the handful who formed a fierce group called the Little Red Wagon. Piercy&rsquo;s characters make vivid and comprehensible the desperation, the courage, and the blind rage of a time when &ldquo;action&rdquo; could appear to some to be a more rational choice than the vote. </p>

As both a successful model to be imitated and as a devastating failure to be avoided. All of the interpretations are tendentious. Historians view the working class&rsquo;s three-month rule through their own prism, distant in time and space. <em>Voices of the Paris Commune</em> takes a different tack. In this book only those who were present in the spring of 1871, who lived through and participated in the Commune, are heard.</p>
<p>The Paris Commune had a vibrant press, and it is represented here by its most important newspaper, <em>Le Cri du Peuple</em>, edited by Jules Vall&egrave;s, member of the First International. Like any legitimate government, the Paris Commune held parliamentary sessions and issued daily printed reports of the heated, contentious deliberations that belie any accusation of dictatorship. Included in this collection is the transcript of the debate in the Commune, just days before its final defeat, on the establishing of a Committee of Public Safety and on the fate of the hostages held by the Commune, hostages who would ultimately be killed.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>Voices of the Paris Commune</em> contains a selection from the inquiry carried out twenty years after the event by the intellectual review <em>La Revue Blanche</em>, asking participants to judge the successes and failures of the Paris Commune. This section provides a fascinating range of opinions of this epochal event.</p>"

He has used his body to block Navy ships headed for Vietnam and trains loaded with munitions on their way to El Salvador and Nicaragua. He has crossed borders to meet &ldquo;the enemy&rdquo; in East Berlin, Castro&rsquo;s Cuba, and present-day Iran. He has marched with mothers confronting a violent regime in Guatemala and stood with refugees threatened by death squads in the Philippines.</p>
<p><em>Waging Peace</em> is a testament to the difference one person can make. Hartsough&rsquo;s stories inspire, educate, and encourage readers to find ways to work for a more just and peaceful world. Inspired by the examples of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., Hartsough has spent his life experimenting with the power of active nonviolence. It is the story of one man&rsquo;s effort to live as though we were all brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Engaging stories on every page provide a peace activist&rsquo;s eyewitness account of many of the major historical events of the past sixty years, including the Civil Rights and anti&ndash;Vietnam War movements in the United States and the little-known but equally significant nonviolent efforts in the Soviet Union, Kosovo, Palestine, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Hartsough&rsquo;s story demonstrates the power and effectiveness of organized nonviolent action. But <em>Waging Peace</em> is more than one man&rsquo;s memoir. Hartsough shows how this struggle is waged all over the world by ordinary people committed to ending the spiral of violence and war.</p>"

Here readers will find representations of the lazy, childlike Sambo, the watermelon-obsessed pickaninny, the buffoonish minstrel, the subhuman savage, the loyal and contented mammy and Tom, and the menacing, razor-toting coon and brute.</p>
<p>Malcolm X and James Baldwin both refused to eat watermelon in front of white people. They were aware of the jokes and other stories about African Americans stealing watermelons, fighting over watermelons, even being transformed into watermelons. Did racial stories influence the actions of white fraternities and sororities who dressed in blackface and mocked black culture, or employees who hung nooses in their workplaces? What stories did the people who refer to Serena Williams and other dark-skinned athletes as apes or baboons hear? Is it possible that a white South Carolina police officer who shot a fleeing black man had never heard stories about scary black men with straight razors or other weapons? Antiblack stories still matter.</p>
<p><em>Watermelons, Nooses, and Straight Razors</em> uses images from the Jim Crow Museum, the nation&rsquo;s largest publicly accessible collection of racist objects. These images are evidence of the social injustice that Martin Luther King Jr. referred to as &ldquo;a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be exposed to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.&rdquo; Each chapter concludes with a story from the author&rsquo;s journey, challenging the integrity of racial narratives.</p>"

This collection asks, &ldquo;Is there a way out?&rdquo; How do we break capital, a form of social organisation that dehumanises us and threatens to annihilate us completely? How do we create a world based on the mutual recognition of human dignity?</p>
<p>Holloway&rsquo;s work answers loudly, &ldquo;By screaming NO!&rdquo; By thinking from our own anger and creativity. By trying to recover the &ldquo;we&rdquo; buried under the categories of capitalist thought. By opening those categories and discovering the antagonism they conceal and by discovering that behind the concepts of money, state, capital, crisis, and so on, there moves our resistance-and-rebellion.</p>
<p>An approach sometimes referred to as Open Marxism, it is an attempt to rethink Marxism as daily struggle. The articles move forward, influenced by the German state derivation debates of the 1970s, by the CSE debates in Britain, and the group around the Edinburgh journal <em>Common Sense</em>, and then moving on to Mexico and the wonderful stimulus of the Zapatista uprising, and now the continuing whirl of discussion with colleagues and students in the Posgrado de Sociolog&iacute;a of the Benem&eacute;rita Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Puebla.</p>"

How do you fight an enemy in your midst? <em>We Go Where They Go </em>recounts the thrilling story of a massive forgotten youth movement that set the stage for today's anti-fascist organizing in North America.</b> When skinheads and punks in the late 1980s found their communities invaded by white supremacists and neo-nazis, they fought back. Influenced by anarchism, feminism, Black liberation, and Indigenous sovereignty, they created Anti-Racist Action. At ARA’s height in the 1990s, thousands of dedicated activists in hundreds of chapters joined the fights—political and sometimes physical—against nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, anti-abortion fundamentalists, and racist police. Before media pundits, cynical politicians, and your uncle discovered “antifa,” Anti-Racist Action was bringing it to the streets.</p>
<p>Based on extensive interviews with dozens of ARA participants, <em>We Go Where They Go</em> tells ARA’s story from within, giving voice to those who risked their safety in their own defense and in solidarity with others. In reproducing the posters, zines, propaganda and photos of the movement itself, this essential work of radical history illustrates how cultural scenes can become powerful forces for change. Here at last is the story of an organic yet highly organized movement, exploring both its triumphs and failures, and offering valuable lessons for today’s generation of activists and rabble-rousers. <em>We Go Where They Go</em> is a page-turning history of grassroots anti-racism.

Inspired by the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who called for a &ldquo;true revolution of values&rdquo; against the racism, militarism, and materialism which he saw as the heart of a society &ldquo;approaching spiritual death,&rdquo; this book recognizes that&mdash;for the most part&mdash;the traditional peace movement has not been moved far beyond the half-century-old call for a deepening critique of its own prejudices. While reviewing the major points of intersection between white supremacy and the war machine through both historic and contemporary articles from a diverse range of scholars and activists, the editors emphasize what needs to be done now to move forward for lasting social change. Produced in collaboration with the War Resisters League, the book also examines the strategic possibilities of radical transformation through revolutionary nonviolence.</p>
<p>Among the historic texts included are rarely-seen writings by antiracist icons such as Anne Braden, Barbara Deming, and Audre Lorde, as well as a dialogue between Dr. King, revolutionary nationalist Robert F.

We hear the inspiring voices of ordinary citizens and activists practicing a cutting-edge form of organizing developed by the nonprofit law firm, the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). Their methodology is an answer for the frustrations of untold numbers of activists who have been defeated time and again by corporate political power and legal entitlement.</p>
<p>Instead of fighting against what we don&rsquo;t want, this book can teach us to create from the ground up what we do want, basing our vision in local control and law. By refusing to cooperate with the unjust laws that favor corporate profit over local sustainability, communities can show the way forward, driving their rights into state constitutions and, eventually, into the federal Constitution.</p>
<p>In communities from New Hampshire to Oregon, new forms of local organizing have sprung up to fight fracking, mining, dumping of toxic waste, and industrial agriculture, among other environmental assaults. These communities have recognized that the law has &ldquo;legalized&rdquo; the damaging actions of corporations, while providing no recourse against harm, and they have therefore decided to create a new system of law that makes local control and sustainability legal. Starting small, this process has spread from rural Pennsylvania to larger cities and towns, and has resulted in the creation of state networks seeking to amend state constitutions.</p>
<p>This work is about finishing the American Revolution by giving up the illusion of democracy and forging a system of true self-governance. In addition, this is about recognizing in law, for the first time in history, that nature possesses legally enforceable rights of its own.</p>"

A man travels from Japan to Latin America in search of revolutionary purpose and finds much more than he bargains for&hellip;. A journalist investigates a poisoning at an elementary school and gets lost in an underworld of buried crimes, secret societies, and haunted forests&hellip;. Two young killers, exiled from Japan, find a new beginning as resistance fighters in Peru&hellip;.</p>
<p>These are but a few of the stories told in <em>We, the Children of Cats</em>, a new collection of provocative early works by Tomoyuki Hoshino, winner of the 2011 Kenzaburo Oe Award in Literature and author of the powerhouse novel <em>Lonely Hearts Killer</em> (PM Press, 2009). Drawing on sources as diverse as Borges, Nabokov, Garcia-Marquez, Kenji Nakagami and traditional Japanese folklore, Hoshino creates a challenging, slyly subversive literary world all his own. By turns teasing and terrifying, laconic and luminous, the stories in this anthology demonstrate Hoshino&rsquo;s view of literature as &ldquo;an art that wavers, like a heat shimmer, between joy at the prospect of becoming something else and despair at knowing that such a transformation is ultimately impossible&hellip;a novel&rsquo;s words trace the pattern of scars left by the struggle between these two feelings.&rdquo; Blending an uncompromising ethical vision with exuberant, freewheeling imagery and bracing formal experimentation, the five short stories and three novellas included in <em>We, the Children of Cats</em> show the full range and force of Hoshino&rsquo;s imagination; the anthology also includes an afterword by translator and editor Brian Bergstrom and a new preface by Hoshino himself.</p>"

Some took their revolutionary politics to the streets, others decided simply to turn away, seeking to build another world together, outside the state and the market. <em>West of Eden</em> charts the remarkable flowering of communalism in the 1960s and &rsquo;70s, fueled by a radical rejection of the Cold War corporate deal, utopian visions of a peaceful green planet, the new technologies of sound and light, and the ancient arts of ecstatic release. The book focuses on the San Francisco Bay Area and its hinterlands, which have long been creative spaces for social experiment. Haight-Ashbury&rsquo;s gift economy&mdash;its free clinic, concerts, and street theatre&mdash;and Berkeley&rsquo;s liberated zones&mdash;Sproul Plaza, Telegraph Avenue, and People&rsquo;s Park&mdash;were embedded in a wider network of producer and consumer co-ops, food conspiracies, and collective schemes.</p>
<p>Using memoir and flashbacks, oral history and archival sources, <em>West of Eden</em> explores the deep historical roots and the enduring, though often disavowed, legacies of the extraordinary pulse of radical energies that generated forms of collective life beyond the nuclear family and the world of private consumption, including the contradictions evident in such figures as the guru/predator or the hippie/entrepreneur. There are vivid portraits of life on the rural communes of Mendocino and Sonoma, and essays on the Black Panther communal households in Oakland, the latter-day Diggers of San Francisco, the Native American occupation of Alcatraz, the pioneers of live/work space for artists, and the Bucky dome as the iconic architectural form of the sixties. </p>
<p>Due to the prevailing amnesia&mdash;partly imposed by official narratives, partly self-imposed in the aftermath of defeat&mdash;<em>West of Eden</em> is not only a necessary act of reclamation, helping to record the unwritten stories of the motley generation of communards and antinomians now passing, but is also intended as an offering to the coming generation who will find here, in the rubble of the twentieth century, a past they can use&mdash;indeed one they will need&mdash;in the passage from the privations of commodity capitalism to an ample life in common.</p>"

Anarchism is opposed to states, armies, slavery, the wages system, the landlord system, prisons, capitalism, bureaucracy, meritocracy, theocracy, revolutionary governments, patriarchy, matriarchy, monarchy, oligarchy, and every other kind of coercive institution. In other words, anarchism opposes government in all its forms.</p>
<p>Enlarged and updated for a modern audience, <em>What Is Anarchism?</em> has the making of a standard reference book. As an introduction to the development of anarchist thought, it will be useful not only to propagandists and proselytizers of anarchism but also to teachers and students of political theory, philosophy, sociology, history, and to all who want to uncover the basic core of anarchism.</p>
<p>This useful compendium, compiled and edited by the late Vernon Richards of Freedom Press, with additional selections by Donald Rooum, includes extracts from the work of Errico Malatesta, Peter Kropotkin, Max Stirner, Emma Goldman, Charlotte Wilson, Michael Bakunin, Rudolf Rocker, Alexander Berkman, Colin Ward, Albert Meltzer, and many others.</p>

In these heady moments they have fuzzy boundaries, no membership lists&mdash;everybody is too engaged in what&rsquo;s coming next, in creating the new, looking to the horizon. But movements get blocked, they slow down, they cease to move, or continue to move without considering their actual effects. When this happens, they can stifle new developments, suppress the emergence of new forms of politics; or fail to see other possible directions. Many movements just stop functioning as movements. They become those strange political groups of yesteryear, arguing about history as worlds pass by. Sometimes all it takes to get moving again is a nudge in a new direction&hellip; We think now is a good time to ask the question: What is winning?

Blizzard,Edited by,Wess Harris,,,,,,,,,,,21.95,"<p>In the first half of the 20th century, strikes and Union battles, murders and frame-ups, were common in every industrial center in the U.S. But none of these episodes compared in scope to the West Virginia Mine Wars.</p>
<p>The uprisings of coal miners that defined the Mine Wars of the 1920&rsquo;s were a direct result of the Draconian rule of the coal companies. The climax was the Battle of Blair Mountain, the largest open and armed rebellion in U.S. history. The Battle, and Union leader Bill Blizzard&rsquo;s quest for justice, was only quelled when the U.S. Army brought guns, poison gas and aerial bombers to stop the 10,000 bandanna-clad miners who formed the spontaneous &ldquo;Red Neck Army.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Over half a century ago, William C. Blizzard wrote the definitive insider&rsquo;s history of the Mine Wars and the resulting trial for treason of his father, the fearless leader of the Red Neck Army. Events dramatized in John Sayles film <em>Matewan</em>, and fictionalized in Denise Giardina&rsquo;s stirring novel <em>Storming Heaven</em>, are here recounted as they occurred. This is a people&rsquo;s history, complete with previously unpublished family photos and documents. If it brawls a little, and brags a little, and is angry more than a little, well, the people in this book were that way.</p>"

It introduces a new language to enable negotiators and activists to argue and collaborate across different schools of thought and action. Weaving beautiful storytelling and clear analysis, this book maps the habits of change-makers, explaining why some groups choose dialogue and negotiation while others practice confrontation and resistance. Why do some groups seemingly always take an antagonistic approach, challenging authority and in some cases trying to tear down our systems and institutions? Why are other groups reluctant to raise their voices or take a stand, limiting themselves to conciliatory strategies? And why do some of us ask only the first question, while others ask only the second?</p>



<p>Threaded among examples of conflict, struggle, and change in organizations, communities, and society is the compelling personal story that led Subar to her community of practice at Dragonfly, advising leaders in social justice organizations on organizational and advocacy strategy. With lucid charts and graphs by Rosi Greenberg, <em>When to Talk and When to Fight</em> is a brilliant new way of talking about how we change the world. In his foreword, Douglas Stone, coauthor of the international best-seller <em>Difficult Conversations</em>, makes the case that negotiators need this language. In a separate forward, Esteban Kelly, cofounder of AORTA Anti-Oppression Resource and Training Alliance, explains why radicals and progressives need it. If you are a change-maker, you will soon find yourself speaking this language. Be one of the first to learn it. Read this book.</p>"

<p>For Ruby, every person is unique and has a story to tell, whether it is skinhead taxi driver Steve, retired teacher and rocker Pearl, magic-mushroom expert Danny Wax Cap, or former merchant seaman Ron Dawes. She encourages people to tell their tales, thrilled by the images created. Outside of work she drinks, dances, and has fun with her friends, at the same time dealing with her mother&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s and a vision from the past, aware that physical and mental health are precious and easily lost. The epitome of positive thinking, Ruby sees the best in everyone&mdash;until the day true evil comes to call.</p>
<p>A mystery figure roams the corridors of Ruby&rsquo;s state-run hospital. He carries special medicine and a very different set of values. He tells himself that he wants to help, increase efficiency, but cost-cutting leads to social cleansing as humans are judged according to that white-trash agenda. Excuses and justifications flow as notions of heaven and hell are distorted. Set against a background of pirate radio stations, pink Cadillacs, and freeway dreams, <em>White Trash</em> insists there is no such thing as white trash.</p>"

It includes a range of formats, from sharply framed book reviews and equally pointed polemics and op-eds to more formal essays designed to reach both scholarly and popular audiences. The selection also represents the broad range of topics addressed in Churchill&rsquo;s scholarship, including the fallacies of archeological and anthropological orthodoxy such as the insistence of &ldquo;cannibalogists&rdquo; that American Indians were traditionally maneaters, Hollywood&rsquo;s cinematic degradations of native people, questions of American Indian identity, the historical and ongoing genocide of North America&rsquo;s native peoples, and the systematic distortion of the political and legal history of U.S.-Indian relations.</p>
<p>Less typical of Churchill&rsquo;s oeuvre are the essays commemorating Cherokee anthropologist Robert K. Thomas and Yankton Sioux legal scholar and theologian Vine Deloria Jr. More unusual still is his profoundly personal effort to come to grips with the life and death of his late wife, Leah Renae Kelly, thereby illuminating in very human terms the grim and lasting effects of Canada&rsquo;s residential schools upon the country&rsquo;s indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>A foreword by Seneca historian Barbara Alice Mann describes the sustained efforts by police and intelligence agencies as well as university administrators and other academic adversaries to discredit or otherwise &ldquo;neutralize&rdquo; both the man and his work.

Clark,,,,,,,,,,,29.95,"<p>William Godwin has long been known for his literary connections as the husband of Mary Wollstonecraft, the father of Mary Shelley, the friend of Coleridge, Lamb, and Hazlitt, the mentor of the young Wordsworth, Southey, and Shelley, and the opponent of Malthus. Godwin has been recently recognized, however, as the most capable exponent of philosophical anarchism, an original moral thinker, a pioneer in socialist economics and progressive education, and a novelist of great skill.</p>
<p>His long life straddled two centuries. Not only did he live at the center of radical and intellectual London during the French Revolution, he also commented on some of the most significant changes in British history. Shaped by the Enlightenment, he became a key figure in English Romanticism.</p>
<p>Basing his work on extensive published and unpublished materials, Peter Marshall has written a comprehensive study of this flamboyant and fascinating figure. Marshall places Godwin firmly in his social, political, and historical context; he traces chronologically the origin and development of Godwin&rsquo;s ideas and themes; and he offers a critical estimate of his works, recognizing the equal value of his philosophy and literature and their mutual illumination.</p>
<p>The picture of Godwin that emerges is one of a complex man and a subtle and revolutionary thinker, one whose influence was far greater than is usually assumed. In the final analysis, Godwin stands forth not only as a rare example of a man who excelled in both philosophy and literature but as one of the great humanists in the Western tradition.</p>"

Thompson,Introduction by,Peter Linebaugh,,,,,,,,,,,32.95,"<p>William Morris&mdash;the great 19th-century craftsman, designer, poet and writer&mdash;remains a monumental figure whose influence resonates powerfully today. As an intellectual (and author of the seminal utopian <em>News from Nowhere</em>), his concern with artistic and human values led him to cross what he called the &ldquo;river of fire&rdquo; and become a committed socialist&mdash;committed not to some theoretical formula but to the day by day struggle of working women and men in Britain and to the evolution of his ideas about art, about work and about how life should be lived.</p>
<p>Many of his ideas accorded none too well with the reforming tendencies dominant in the labour movement, nor with those of &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; Marxism, which has looked elsewhere for inspiration. Both sides have been inclined to venerate Morris rather than to pay attention to what he said.</p>

<p><em>Wisdom Teeth</em> is a questioning work, a redefining of personal relationships, masculinity, race, and history. It&rsquo;s a readjustment of bite, humor, and perspective as Brown channels hip-hop, Toni Morrison, and Snagglepuss to make way for the shudder and eruption of wisdom.</p>"

This surge of violence has occurred alongside an expansion of capitalist social relations. In this new work that revisits some of the main themes of <em>Caliban and the Witch</em>, Silvia Federici examines the root causes of these developments and outlines the consequences for the women affected and their communities. She argues that, no less than the witch hunts in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe and the &ldquo;New World,&rdquo; this new war on women is a structural element of the new forms of capitalist accumulation. These processes are founded on the destruction of people&rsquo;s most basic means of reproduction. Like at the dawn of capitalism, what we discover behind today&rsquo;s violence against women are processes of enclosure, land dispossession, and the remolding of women&rsquo;s reproductive activities and subjectivity.</p>

<p>As well as an investigation into the causes of this new violence, the book is also a feminist call to arms. Federici&rsquo;s work provides new ways of understanding the methods in which women are resisting victimization and offers a powerful reminder that reconstructing the memory of the past is crucial for the struggles of the present.</p>"

The collection offers both historical and contemporary Marxist feminist analysis of how the reproduction of labour and life functions under capitalism.</p>
<p>Dalla Costa&rsquo;s essays, speeches, and political interventions provide insight into the vibrant and combative women&rsquo;s movement that emerged in Italy and across the world in the early 1970s. Since the publication of <em>Women and the Subversion of the Community</em> (1972), Dalla Costa has been a central figure in the development of autonomist thought in a wide range of anticapitalist and feminist social movements. Her detailed research and provocative thinking deepens our understanding of the role of women&rsquo;s struggles for autonomy and control over their bodies and labour. These essays provide critical and relevant ideas for anticapitalists, antiracists, and feminists who are attempting to build counterpower in the age of austerity.</p>"

Published in 1885 while he was in a French jail for anarchist activism, this collection of articles from the newspaper <em>Le Revolt&eacute;</em> sees Kropotkin criticise the failings of capitalism and those who seek to end it by means of its main support, the state. Instead, he urged the creation of a mass movement from below that would expropriate property and destroy the state, replacing their centralised hierarchies with federations of self-governing communities and workplaces.</p>



<p>Kropotkin&rsquo;s instant classic included discussions themes and ideas he returned to repeatedly during his five decades in the anarchist movement. Unsurprisingly, <em>Words of a Rebel</em> was soon translated into numerous languages&mdash;including Italian, Spanish, Bulgarian, Russian, and Chinese&mdash;and reprinted time and time again. But despite its influence as Kropotkin&rsquo;s first anarchist work, it was the last to be completely translated into English.</p>



<p>This is a new translation from the French original by Iain McKay except for a few chapters previously translated by Nicolas Walter. Both anarchist activists and writers, they are well placed to understand the assumptions within and influences on Kropotkin&rsquo;s revolutionary journalism. It includes all the original 1885 text along with the preface to the 1904 Italian as well as the preface and afterward to the 1919 Russian editions. In addition, it includes many articles on the labour movement written by Kropotkin for <em>Le Revolt&eacute;</em> which show how he envisioned getting from criticism to a social revolution. Along with a comprehensive glossary and an introduction by Iain McKay placing this work within the history of anarchism as well as indicating its relevance to radicals and revolutionaries today, this is the definitive edition of an anarchist classic.</p>"

From the temples of ancient Egypt to spacecraft orbiting Earth, workers and ordinary people everywhere have walked out, sat down, risen up, and fought back against exploitation, discrimination, colonization, and oppression.</p>

<p><em>Working Class History</em> presents a distinct selection of people&rsquo;s history through hundreds of &ldquo;on this day in history&rdquo; anniversaries that are as diverse and international as the working class itself. Women, young people, people of color, workers, migrants, Indigenous people, LGBT+ people, disabled people, older people, the unemployed, home workers, and every other part of the working class have organized and taken action that has shaped our world, and improvements in living and working conditions have been won only by years of violent conflict and sacrifice. These everyday acts of resistance and rebellion highlight just some of those who have struggled for a better world and provide lessons and inspiration for those of us fighting in the present. Going day by day, this book paints a picture of how and why the world came to be as it is, how some have tried to change it, and the lengths to which the rich and powerful have gone to maintain and increase their wealth and influence.</p>

<p>This handbook of grassroots movements, curated by the popular Working Class History project, features many hidden histories and untold stories, reinforced with inspiring images, further reading, and a foreword from legendary author and dissident Noam Chomsky.</p>"

And among them will be workers who share an insight: in order to better our lot, we must act collectively to change the world. This profusely illustrated treasury of song sheets, lyrics, photographs, histories, and biographical sketches explores the notion that our best hope lies in the capacity of ordinary working people to awaken to the need to emancipate ourselves and all of humanity.</p>
<p>Featuring over a dozen songwriters, from Joe Hill to Aunt Molly Jackson,<em>Working-Class Heroes</em> delivers a lyrical death blow to the falsehood that so-called political songs of the twentieth century were all written by intellectuals in New York. Many, like Ella May Wiggins, were murdered by the bosses. Others, like Sarah Ogan Gunning, watched their children starve to death and their husbands die of black lung, only to rise up singing against the system that caused so much misery.</p>
<p>Most of the songs collected here are from the early twentieth century, yet their striking relevance to current affairs invites us to explore the historical conditions that inspired their creation: systemic crisis, advancing fascism, and the threat of world war. In the face of violent terror, these working-class songwriters bravely stood up to fight oppression. Such courage is immortal, and the songs of such heroes can still lift our spirits, if we sing them today.</p>
<p>Featured in this twenty-song collection are Sarah Ogan Gunning, Ralph Chaplin, Woody Guthrie, Ella May Wiggins, Joe Hill, Paul Robeson, John Handcox, Aunt Molly Jackson, Jim Garland, Alfred Hayes, Joseph Brandon, and several anonymous proletarian songwriters whose names have been long forgotten, though their words will never die.</p>"

Their confrontational comics shine a little reality on the fantasy world of the American kleptocracy, and have inspired the developing popularity and recognition of comics as a respected art form.</p>
<p>This full-color retrospective exhibition is arranged thematically, including housing rights, feminism, environmental issues, religion, police brutality, globalization, and depictions of conflicts from the Middle East to the Midwest. <em>World War 3 Illustrated</em> isn&rsquo;t about a war that may happen; it&rsquo;s about the ongoing wars being waged around the world and on our very own doorsteps. <em>World War 3 Illustrated</em> also illuminates the war we wage on each other&mdash;and sometimes the one taking place in our own minds. <em>World War 3</em> artists have been covering the topics that matter for over 30 years, and they&rsquo;re just getting warmed up.</p>
<p>Contributors include Sue Coe, Eric Drooker, Fly, Sandy Jimenez, Sabrina Jones, Peter Kuper, Mac McGill, Kevin Pyle, Spain Rodriguez, Nicole Schulman, Seth Tobocman, Susan Willmarth, and dozens more.</p>"

Combining new revelations from the past with sketches of a sane path forward, this is a deliberate collection looking at our past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Sociologist Wess Harris (<em>When Miners March</em>) further documents the infamous Esau scrip system for women, suggesting an institutionalized practice of forced sexual servitude that was part of coal company policy. In a conversation with award-winning oral historian Michael Kline, federal mine inspector Larry Layne explains corporate complicity in the 1968 Farmington Mine disaster which killed seventy-eight men and became the catalyst for the passage of major changes in U.S. mine safety laws. Mine safety expert and whistleblower Jack Spadaro speaks candidly of years of attempts to silence his courageous voice and recalls government and university collaboration in covering up details of the 1972 Buffalo Creek flooding disaster, which killed over a hundred people and left four thousand homeless.</p>
<p>Moving to the next generation of thinkers and activists, attorney Nathan Fetty examines current events in Appalachia and musician Carrie Kline suggests paths forward for people wishing to set their own course rather than depend on the kindness of corporations.</p>"

He&rsquo;s a killer, a dark Latino legend of the Southwest&rsquo;s urban badlands, &ldquo;a child who terrifies adults.&rdquo; They speak of him in whispers in dive bars near closing time. Some claim to have met him. Others say he doesn&rsquo;t exist, a phantom blamed for every unsolved act of violence, a ghost who haunts every blood-splattered crime scene.</p>
<p>But he is real. He&rsquo;s a young man with a love of cooking and reading, an abiding loneliness and an appetite for violence. He is a cipher, a projection of the dreams and nightmares of people ignored by Phoenix&rsquo;s economic boom&hellip;and a contemporary outlaw in search of an ordinary life. Love brings him the chance at a new life in the form of Vanjii, a beautiful, damaged woman. But try as he might to abandon the past, his past won&rsquo;t abandon him. The Kid fights back in the only way he knows &ndash; and sets in motion a tragic sequence of events that lead him to an explosive conclusion shocking in its brutality and tenderness.</p>"

Its influence has reached far beyond musical genres and subcultural divides. Today it is more diverse and richly complex than ever, and in the past decade alcohol and drug use have become a much-discussed issue in radical politics, not least due to the hard work, dedication, and commitment to social and environmental justice found among straight-edge activists.</p>
<p><em>X: Straight Edge and Radical Sobriety</em> is Gabriel Kuhn&rsquo;s highly anticipated follow-up to his critically acclaimed <em>Sober Living for the Revolution</em>. In this impressive volume, Kuhn continues his reconnaissance of straight-edge culture and how it overlaps with radical politics. Extensively illustrated and combining original interviews and essays with manifestos and reprints from zines and pamphlets, <em>X</em> is a vital portrait of the wide spectrum of people who define straight-edge culture today.</p>
<p>In the sprawling scope of this book, the notion of straight edge as a bastion of white, middle-class, cis males is openly confronted and boldly challenged by dozens of contributors who span five continents. <em>X</em> takes a piercing look at religion, identity, feminism, aesthetics, harm reduction, and much more. It is both a call to action and an elaborate redefinition of straight edge and radical sobriety.</p>
<p>Promising to inspire discussion, reflection, and unearth hidden chapters of hardcore punk history, <em>X: Straight Edge and Radical Sobriety</em> is of crucial importance to anybody interested in the politics of punk and social transformation.</p>"

Zane McNeill,,,,,,,,,,,,,20.00,"<p><em>Y'all Means All</em> is a celebration of the weird and wonderful aspects of a troubled region in all of their manifest glory! This collection is a thought-provoking hoot and a holler of ""we&rsquo;re queer and we&rsquo;re here to stay, cause we&rsquo;re every bit a piece of the landscape as the rocks and the trees"" echoing through the hills of Appalachia and into the boardrooms of every media outlet and opportunistic author seeking to define Appalachia from the outside for their own political agendas. Multidisciplinary and multi-genre, <em>Y&rsquo;all</em> necessarily incorporates elements of critical theory, such as critical race theory and queer theory, while dealing with a multitude of methodologies, from quantitative analysis, to oral history and autoethnography.</p>



<p>This collection eschews the contemporary trend of ""reactive"" or ""responsive"" writing in the genre of Appalachian studies, and alternatively, provides examples of how modern Appalachians are defining themselves on their own terms. As such, it also serves as a toolkit for other Appalachian readers to follow suit, and similarly challenge the labels, stereotypes and definitions often thrust upon them. While providing blunt commentary on the region's past and present, the book&rsquo;s soul is sustained by the resilience, ingenuity, and spirit exhibited by the authors; values which have historically characterized the Appalachian region and are continuing to define its culture to the present.</p>



<p>This book demonstrates above all else that Appalachia and its people are filled with a vitality and passion for their region which will slowly but surely effect long-lasting and positive changes in the region. If historically Appalachia has been treated as a ""mirror"" of the country, this book breaks that trend by allowing modern Appalachians to examine their own reflections and to share their insights in an honest, unfiltered manner with the world.</p>"

James (1901&ndash;1989), known in much later years as the &ldquo;last great Pan-Africanist.&rdquo; The son of a provincial school administrator in British-governed Trinidad, James disappointed his family by embracing the culture and passions of the colonial underclass, Carnival and cricket. He joined the literary avant-garde of the island before leaving for Britain. In the UK, James swiftly became a beloved cricket journalist, playwright for his close friend Paul Robeson, and a pathbreaking scholar of black history with <em>The Black Jacobins</em> (1938), the first history of the Haitian revolt.</p>
<p>The artistic skills of Milton Knight, at once acute and provocative, bring out James&rsquo;s unique personality, how it arose, and how he became a world figure.</p>"

<p>The utopian vision of <em>Your Place or Mine?</em> is vital to a just society: the invention of a world where one can be <em>human</em> without having to be classified by sexual practices or gender expressions. Where one need not find shelter in definition or assimilation. A refreshing reminder that we are not all the same, nor do we need to be.</p>"

They have infused Left politics with a distinct imaginary—and an imaginative, literary or poetic dimension—organizing horizontally, outside and against the state, and with a profound respect for difference as a source of political insight, not division. Marcos’s inspiring and sometimes Kafkaesque stories bear witness to how a defense of indigenous traditions can become a lever for the construction of a new anti-capitalist and anti-patriarchal world. With commentaries that illuminate their historical, political, and literary contexts and an introduction by the translators, this timeless elegiac volume is perfect for lovers of literature and lovers of revolution.</p>"
