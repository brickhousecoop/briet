From the introduction by Eleanor Arnason: ""Sargent has a quality usually associated with hard SF: a certain kind of intellectual rigor. With her, it carries through all of her work. She thinks things through. ... Notice, when you read this collection, how many different kinds of stories are here and notice the range of moods: the stories go from really funny to really dark, with a lot in between. ... I also want to mention Sargent's persistence. Writing is a hard life. Many good woman writers I admired in the 1970s, '80s and '90s have vanished. They stopped writing or stopped trying to sell their fiction or changed their names and moved to writing romance, gay romance, generic fantasy -- whatever they could sell. In one way or another, they were silenced. Sargent has kept doing thoughtful, serious fiction, dealing with the issues that interested her.""","20150101","Sargent, Pamela","Author","Arnason, Eleanor","Introduction by","","","","","WORLD","","","","29.99","NOK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

That is, they are ""attempts,"" explorations, and, well, also traps, where I wander around a bit in apparent innocence and then spring on readers a possibly outrageous idea, one they wouldn’t have considered for a moment if I hadn’t lulled them (you) into trusting me a bit. Some of the essays are also in the satiric tradition, where one tries for some startling combinations of learnéd language and vulgarity, short shocker sentences in the midst of some knotty convolutions.<P>
Anyway, the essays usually do come to some fairly clear, fairly serious, non-random conclusion and Views can’t be entirely without form. So my initial editor and I have arranged them into categories. The over-arching, “meta” category for most is POLITICS or POLITICS AND CULTURE: I was brought up political in Chicago and have remained true to my breeding as a thoroughly political animal, and, of course, I am a student of, and participant in, at least a couple of cultures.","20170101","Erlich, Richard D.","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","5.99","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Beagle, David Stevens examines the fantasy of American writer Peter S. Beagle. He finds a consistent view of the world and an almost overpowering sense of humor, leading him to conclude that Beagle believes that love is the best thing we have and the only reason for living. His work will be read and enjoyed for generations to come, and Stevens tells you why. Beagle indulges in what Stevens terms ""metaphysical speculations”: a working-out of the possibilities of the world being different than it is. He invites the reader to examine these speculations with him, and when we do, to come away from the experience as better men and women, believing in the transforming power of love and laughing at ourselves in the process. No writer could ask for more, or succeed better. Beagle would have us believe, to paraphrase Shakespeare's Hamlet, that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy.

His literary pieces earned him much fame and attention during his lifetime and led him to win many awards for his work. His idyllic settings made his novels and plays popular with the public.

Before it’s done you’ll meet ex-con Luke McCracken, ’bo Tom Steever, landlady Sadie Hippolyte, inventor Dirk Mattox and his fiancée Iolanthe Silverthorne, and wealthy gad-about-town Oliver Oliver. Not to mention a host of celestials and a gaggle of cops—all of them affected one way or another by the six-fingered green jade hand.

Instruction is provided in three forms: (1) resident, (2) correspondence, and (3) traveling lecture teams. The base for all three types of instruction is the same.
<p>
Experience attests to the great value of the correspondence course. The subject matter is presented in small volumes for convenience, each volume representing a major division of the subject. They are reorganized and revised from time to time to bring them up to date and to place emphasis as change may dictate upon those phases of the course deemed most important. Considerable background and illustrative materials are included as a basis for broad and comprehensive education in the field of world resources and their use in support of national objectives.
<p>
The texts consist of materials written by members of the faculty of the Industrial College, of selected lectures delivered at the College, and of selections from various publications. The texts in use were prepared mainly by the Correspondence Text Committee of the Education Division of the College. Current revisions of these texts are prepared by the Branches of the Education Division and coordinated by the Committee, which consists of Dr. Benjamin H. Williams, Chairman, Dr. Harold J. Clem, Dr. Louis C. Hunter, Dr. Andrew J. Kress, and Dr. Samuel H. McGuire. Suggestions and recommendations are based on the instructional policy of the Correspondence Study Branch as well as on student reactions to text materials.

The Industrial College owes a debt of gratitude to a number of lecturers, writers, and publishers who have permitted the use of their materials in this series of texts.

The people who buy, sell, study, manipulate, and in short have to do with steel thirst for an insight into steel and its structure because they need this insight in their jobs and do not find it easy to come by (true).

"9781479452743","","The Son of Tarzan","","Wildside Press LLC","Wildside Press","20200824","20200824","","","","Digital original","FIC004000","FC","","","eng","309","In this novel, for the first and only time in the Tarzan series, the main character is not Tarzan himself but his son Jack, who becomes known as Korak, first introduced (as a baby) in the earlier novels The Eternal Lover (1914/15) and The Beasts of Tarzan (1914). Korak would return as a supporting character in the later novels Tarzan the Terrible (1921), Tarzan and the Golden Lion (1922/23) and Tarzan and the Ant Men (1924).

The story begins 10 years after the conclusion of The Beasts of Tarzan. During the past decade, Alexis Paulvitch, who had escaped Tarzan at the end of the last novel, has lived a hideous life of abuse and disease among tribal people in Africa. Now he is discovered by a European ship and taken aboard. In the months that follows, Paulvitch encounters the ape, Akut, (whom Tarzan had befriended in that previous story) at one of the ship's stops. Because of Akut's interactions with Tarzan, he is unafraid of white men, and Paulvitch, unaware of the previous relationship, sees an opportunity to make some money. He takes Akut to London and begins displaying him publicly.

After the trauma of the kidnappings ten years earlier, Jane has refused to return to Africa or to allow Jack to know anything about his father's past for fear that he might somehow try to relive it. Perhaps she instinctively knew that Jack was somehow very connected to Tarzan's old life, for Jack did have an avid interest in wildlife and he was extremely athletic. When the Claytons hear about the displayed ape, they forbid Jack from going to see it. But he sneaks off and does so anyway. John Clayton follows his son and is surprised to find the ape is his old friend, Akut, and begins conversing with him. Jack is amazed to see that his father could do so. John then tells Jack of his life as Tarzan.<P>
Jack continues sneaking away to see Akut and begins to learn the language of the apes. Jack forms a plan to take Akut back to the jungle. Paulvitch, seeing an opportunity for revenge against Tarzan, agrees to help Jack. They escape to an African port where Paulvitch attacks Jack. Akut kills Paulvitch, and Jack, terrified, escapes into the jungle with him, thinking he will have to run for the rest of his life.<P>
Like Tarzan before him, Jack learns survival in the jungle and encounters the Mangani apes, who he can speak with because of his dialogue with Akut. Akut has difficulty pronouncing the name ""Jack"" and names him Korak, which means ""killer"" which seems appropriate since Jack has proven himself to be such.","20200101","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Author","Wurf, Karl","Introduction by","","","","","WORLD","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

Their equipment gradually wears out and to all outward appearance, they seem to be primitive savages, living by hunting and farming.<P>
When a coup removes Colonel Marcus Harris, commander of the maintenance battalion, in favor of his executive officer, the colonel and a loyal second lieutenant, Kurt Dixon, are jailed. When Dixon escapes, he hides in a battle suit to avoid detection. He accidentally activates it and is propelled into outer space. There, he is rescued by a scout of the new Galactic Protectorate…a ramshackle, barely-functioning organization whose leaders are fighting amongst themselves. The Galactic Protectorate, despite its name, has lost most of the technical expertise to do even routine maintenance on their own equipment.<P>
Both sides have something the other needs. But can they possibly work together? And if they do, will it be war -- or the start of a new Galactic Empire?<P>

And to bolster his argument, Suvin points to the economic and social chaos creeping and growing through western society, bank failures, riots, unrest, loss of private capital, loss of middle-class jobs, increase in drug and alcohol abuse, proliferation of guns and other weapons in society, failure of our school systems, inability of police to provide security, and political revolution in less-developed states. The author stresses the need to provide ""universal guaranteed income sufficient to modestly live on for all adults working 35 hours a week, and a stress on [providing decent] education and health."" And to fund these simple measures: ""Just pay trillions to people instead of banks and the military."" Suvin's intelligent analysis and commentary will open many eyes that have been prejudiced against socialist thought by the rise of right-wing politicians, and demonstrate quite clearly to the modern reader that there IS another perspective worth considering.","20120101","Suvin, Darko","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","4.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Although his own distinctive work was very popular in the SF magazines of the time, the ambitious Fearn wanted to increase his number of acceptances by writing under pseudonyms in the style of Weinbaum! In the late 1930s, the American SF magazine market boomed, and all of Fearn's Weinbaum pastiches found billets. These intriguing stories are here identified and collected for the first time, with fascinating background notes.

Her feet hit first and instantly shot out from under her, and she fell backward with a thud that stunned her. She caught a glimpse of a trap door closing over her head as she slid rapidly down the incline into darkness.""

A-Z Publications has provided Adelle Gernyan with a great salary and office but the mundane work assigned her doesn’t merit such treatment. Annoying colleagues, spying maintenance men and a mysterious boss add to the puzzle of her strange job. Adelle’s boredom changes to terror when she is trapped under her office building with her fellow employees. Subjected to hunger, sleep deprivation, deadly traps and the horrors of armed attack, Adelle doesn’t know that she has become part of a vicious experiment on the human mind labeled only as “The Telo-um Test”… a test with death as its final grade.

This is a griping suspense story from an acknowledged master of mystery and science fiction, Lloyd Biggle, Jr.","20130101","Biggle Jr., Lloyd","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","2.99","EUR","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

<P>
Some have told me that the events of Ship Years 8 and 9 were far too terrible to use as underpinning for a light fantasy romance, and one that in any case can appeal chiefly to the hundred or so avid Savoyards in the ship's population. My response is that light treatment has been among humanity's most effective defense mechanisms for dealing with disaster, probably since our race became recognizably human back in Old Earth's paleolithic; and that Savoy enthusiasm is as precious in Papa's Pride as any other artifact of our Old Earth heritage.<P>
In any case, these things lie more than half a century in our own past, and if half a century does not make them fair game for historical fantasy, what does? Is the past not the past, whether ten or ten thousand years ago, whether back on Old Earth or out here in our great colony starship of twenty-four pylons revolving around a vast central core?<P>
While retaining the names of such entities as the Antique Terra Theater, which had not yet split into the Order-sponsored Old Earth Company and the committee-sponsored Players to the Stars, with their respective screenplay arms Universal Aspirations and Pride Productions, I have fictionalized the names and other aspects of individuals actually involved in Chuck Wang's crime -- the worst ever perpetrated and, we hope, ever to be perpetrated in Papa's Pride. I have added some completely fictional people to the cast, omitted many historical figures entirely, and somewhat condensed, even rearranged, certain of the events. There were never any deliberate murders connected with Wang's outrage, at least as far as we know. Shipnet will make it very easy for interested readers to collate my tale with as much as we have of the truth.","20140101","Karr, Phyllis Ann","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","3.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Beneath its artificial shell are at least three vast cave-systems, each one the size of an Earth-like world; and beneath those, possibly many more. No one knows how many layers there might be, and no one knows what secrets might be buried down at the ""center""--if there is a center. At some time in the distant past, Asgard had suffered a terrible catastrophe. Now its outer layers are cold, its builders presumed dead. Explorers and exploiters from a hundred different worlds and races are scavenging among the ruins--but deep down, there might still be light, warmth, life...and perils unknown. Mike Rousseau was one of the first humans to come to Asgard, decades earlier. Now he's challenged by both friends and foes--and it's hard to tell them apart on this icebound planet. He might also be the one man who can solve the biggest puzzle in the galaxy...if only he can stay alive!

Joe Hammond was in Rome on furlough after fifteen months at the front. It was to be seven days of excitement and pleasure -- a lifetime of love in one week. The first day he met Maria Consorti who gave him her body for a meal, and then abandoned him for an American capitano. Then he found Nina Bonte, business woman, who left her prosperous Bar Nazionale long enough to have a brief affair with him. And there was sad-eyed Gianna Aragno, too weak from hunger to give Joe her love, and lustful aging Carla Valsetti. Joe left Rome with a feeling of deep sadness for the Eternal City and for the young lives ruined and cast adrift by the war.

He realizes that he had been protected, up till now, by Tansy's charms, and that as a result of his meddling, they are both now powerless to counteract the spells and charms of the other witches all around them.","20230101","Leiber, Fritz","Author","Betancourt, John","Introduction by","","","AD AE AF AG AI AL AM AN AO AQ AR AS AT AU AW AX AZ BA BB BD BE BF BG BH BI BJ BL BM BN BO BQ BR BS BT BV BW BY BZ CA CC CD CF CG CH CI CK CL CM CN CO CR CU CV CW CX CY CZ DE DJ DK DM DO DZ EC EE EG EH ER ET FI FJ FK FM FO FR GA GB GD GE GF GG GH GI GL GM GN GP GQ GR GS GT GU GW GY HK HM HN HR HT HU ID IE IL IM IN IO IQ IR IS IT JE JM JO JP KE KG KH KI KM KN KP KR KW KY KZ LA LB LC LI LK LR LS LT LU LV LY MA MC MD ME MF MG MH MK ML MM MN MO MP MQ MR MS MT MU MV MW MX MY MZ NA NC NE NF NG NI NL NO NP NR NU NZ OM PA PE PF PG PH PK PL PM PN PR PS PT PW PY QA RE RO RS RU RW SA SB SC SD SE SG SH SI SJ SK SL SM SN SO SR SS ST SV SX SY SZ TC TD TF TG TH TJ TK TL TM TN TO TR TT TV TW TZ UA UG UM US UY UZ VA VC VE VG VI VN VU WF WS YE YT ZA ZM ZW","","","","","","0.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","02","02","proprietary","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

""I tell you, Crystal, she'd never been sick a day in her life! The woman was a walking, talking, medical miracle. Winston used to say if everyone in Rowan Springs were as healthy as Millicent Grazziani, he would have to hang his shingle out somewhere else.""<P>
""But, murder, Agnes? Isn't that going a bit too far? Do you really think that puny little guy could get up enough gumption to kill somebody?"" Crystal's laugh was rich and boisterous. ""I remember when he was working as a hairdresser in Mildred's Beauty Box -- that's how he met Millicent in the first place -- he used to go to her house and do her hair twice a week. You could have knocked me over with a straw when he moved in with her. The story was that Millicent hated him. Used to tease him all the time. Called him ‘Willie the wimp.'""<P>
""People are funny,"" agreed Agnes. ""Rich eccentric little old ladies included.""<P>
""Well, there's nothing funny about being the sole heir to one rich, eccentric little old lady's estate. Especially when she kicks the bucket under suspicious circumstances...""","20150101","Sims, E.

While Flora had a long career writing much crime, mystery, and detective fiction, Marcus seems to be his only attempt to create a series character. Marcus, as a character, is marked by his dogged rationality, as he attempts to solve various “inexplicable” murders and crimes, much to the annoyance of his compatriot Bobo Fuller. We have been able to identify nine stories featuring the character—although as always we ask fans and aficionados to inform us of any we have missed. Note: while many online sources list the Fletcher Flora story “The Capsule” (from Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine, December 1964) as being part of the Marcus series, it does not actually feature the character. “The Capsule” can be read in Wildside Press’s The Second Fletcher Flora Mystery MEGAPACK®.<P>We hope you enjoy this classic detective story.","19610101","Flora, Fletcher","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","7.79","NOK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

They’re back now in Homicide House.<P>
The story is laid in postwar London, and Mr. Pinkerton is living at No. 4 Godolphin Square. Despite the fact that he owns the apartment house, he shares meagre quarters on the top floor with the chef. Years of living with the penny-pinching Mrs. Pinkerton (now fortunately deceased) have accustomed him to discomfort, and Mr. Pinkerton is quite happy living where he is.<P>
One day a young American comes swinging along the Square. He attracts Mr. Pinkerton’s attention when he stops in front of No. 22, directly across from No. 4, and now a shell of a house with only a stairway leading nowhere. The American is so obviously distressed at the sight of the bombed-out house, that Mr. Pinkerton breaks a habit of longstanding and speaks to him. When the stranger tells him he is looking for a girl whom he met six years before in an air-raid shelter, and that he knows only that she lived at No. 22 Godolphin Square, Mr. Pinkerton comforts him by revealing that she is living quite safely at the very house in which he himself has rooms.<P>
It takes only one more innocent question to start in motion a train of singularly unpleasant events, and the stranger and Mr. Pinkerton find themselves in the midst of violence and murder.","19490101","Zenith, Brown","Author","Frome, David","Author","","","","","WORLD","","","","29.99","NOK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","Web PDF"

A community or society possessing highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities. It may be a dream, but it's a dream that has inspired writers for thousands of years.

At its second blaring call, imperatively eloquent of deadly haste, the door of the little ferry-shack swung wide and a girl looked out  a girl clad strangely and for rough toil, in faded blue overalls and a checkered mackinaw of felted stuff. For a moment she stood there in the fading light of that chill October evening, peering out across the waters that slid away, cold, dark, foam-streaked, toward the tumbling whirls of Tobique Rapids, four miles below -- the white-lashed, thundering leap whose sullen roar never by day or night was still from shuddering through that northern air...""","20140101","England, George Allen","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","0.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Otherwise life was pleasant for Kirk -- until someone banked $100,000 in his name and a strange girl was killed in his apartment.<P>
Lieutenant Max Gold of Homicide tried to crack the case fast with Kirk as his chief suspect, but ran into trouble after Candy Livingston, queen of the smart-set, made a play for Kirk and the killer struck again -- this time in the Club Caliente, where Dana and Ricardo danced.

Around fifteen years before success as a writer, he frequently changed jobs and roamed across the Russian Empire; these experiences would later influence his writing. Gorky’s most famous works were The Lower Depths (1902), Twenty-six Men and a Girl, The Song of the Stormy Petrel, The Mother, Summerfolk and Children of the Sun. He had an association with fellow Russian writers Leo Tolstoy and Anton Chekhov; Gorky would later write his memoirs on both of them.<P>
Gorky was active with the emerging Marxist social-democratic movement. He publicly opposed the Tsarist regime, and for a time closely associated himself with Vladimir Lenin and Alexander Bogdanov’s Bolshevik wing of the party. For a significant part of his life, he was exiled from Russia and later the Soviet Union. In 1932, he returned to Russia on Joseph Stalin’s personal invitation and died in June 1936.<P>

Not long before Ted Wilford leaves for college, he is asked by the Town Crier’s editor to keep an eye on the salesman who is setting up a trading stamp plan in their town. The editor has no particular reason to suspect anything is wrong, but as a sponsor of the plan, he feels that Ted, with his extensive experience during his high-school days on the paper, can keep a careful eye on the whole set-up if he works in the company’s local sales office for a few weeks.<P>
At first Ted thought the stamp plan was a splendid idea for the town, the stores, and the customers. But several unexplained incidents puzzled him, and almost at once he found himself in the midst of a full-fledged mystery. With the help of his newspaper editor, Ted uncovers a fascinating scheme for counterfeiting the trading stamps. Mixed up in the strange pattern of events is a girl who says she has “lost” her home town. The workings of the trading stamp plan and the ingenious counterfeiting game, plus what Ted learns about the dangers of circumstantial evidence, make the solution of this sixth Ted Wilford mystery especially exciting and interesting.","20170101","Pallas, Norvin","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","15.99","DKK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

""Confusion reigns in this often funny, frequently precious fantasy about usurped thrones and lost heirs. After the Gorgorian barbarians conquer the civilized kingdom of Hydrangea, their leader Gudge makes himself king, marries Hydrangean Princess Artemisia and settles down to a highly satisfactory life of drinking and debauchery. Royal triplets, separated at birth because of a Gorgorian superstition that multiple births suggest the mother's infidelity, receive very different upbringings. The only girl, Avena, is brought up in the palace as Prince Arbol, heir to the throne and a fearsome swordsman. One brother, Wulfrith, is raised by a shepherd; although a young ewe is his favorite companion, his size makes him a fearsome battler. The other brother, Dunwin, reared by the outlawed wizard Clootie, develops into a talented magician. To this basic brew Watt-Evans (the Ethshar series) and Friesner (Gnome Man's Land ) have added a couple of dragons, some attempted seductions, mistaken identities and misguided spells to produce a lighthearted fantasy."" -- Publishers Weekly","20120101","Watt-Evans, Lawrence","Author","Friesner, Esther","Author","","","AE AF AL AM AN AO AQ AR AS AT AW AX AZ BA BB BE BF BG BH BI BJ BL BO BQ BR BV BY CA CC CD CF CG CH CI CK CL CM CN CO CR CS CU CV CW CX CZ DE DJ DK DO DZ EC EE EH ER ES ET FI FM FO FR GA GD GE GF GG GH GI GL GM GN GP GQ GR GS GT GU GW HM HN HR HT HU ID IM IR IS IT JE JP KG KH KI KM KP KR KZ LA LB LI LR LT LU LV LY MA MC MD ME MF MG MH MK ML MN MO MP MQ MR MS MV MX NC NE NF NI NL NO NU OM PA PE PF PH PL PM PR PS PT PW PY QA RE RO RS RU SE SI SJ SK SM SN SR SS ST SV SX SY TC TD TF TG TH TJ TK TL TM TN TO TW UA UM US UY UZ VA VE VI VN WF YT YU","","","","","","4.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

This novel was not intended as a true recreation of Pilgram-era history; instead, it is the author’s attempt to reconcile apparently conflicting historical facts and to explain an otherwise inexplicable situation concerning Native Americans and European settlers. At the time of the Pilgrims, all Native Americans—not excepting those of New England—had suffered repeated outrage at the hands of white men, and in no case had they been given any cause to love the invaders of their country or to welcome their presence. Why, then, did the powerful Massasoit permit a white invasion of his territory that he could so easily have crushed?<P>
Clearly a strong friendship existed from the very first between him and Edward Winslow, and Winslow seems to have exercised a great influence over the New England sachem. What was the origin of this friendship? The Narragansetts, while submitting to Massasoit’s authority, were always in sullen opposition to it. Why?

His collected works represent, among other things, an extended reflection upon the dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialisation. Some of the issues Lawrence explores are sexuality, emotional health, vitality, spontaneity, and instinct.<P>
Lawrence's opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile he called his ""savage pilgrimage"". At the time of his death, his public reputation was that of a pornographer who had wasted his considerable talents. E. M. Forster, in an obituary notice, challenged this widely held view, describing him as ""the greatest imaginative novelist of our generation."" The philosopher Bertrand Russell characterised Lawrence as a proto-German Fascist. Later, the literary critic F. R. Leavis championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness.<P>

There’s Chris Storm, native daughter, glamorous, colorful, with a story so incredible that it has to be taken on faith. Brought up by two grandfathers, she might well have been caught in the meshes of their friendship, their rivalry, their enmity. One grandfather, Thor Storm, had sought in Alaska in his youth that freedom of the frontier it still afforded—and stayed, victim of their lure, seeking through the weekly he published, to maintain that freedom. The other grandfather, Czar Kennedy, was High Mogul, big time operator, who had made his millions in Alaska, but who milked her and played in with the Outside—men from Seattle and San Francisco and Washington who stripped her of her riches for their own ends.

So begins one of the most famous quotations in all of crime fiction. And just as the murder of Sam Spade's partner, Miles Archer, sets off the quest in the great Dashiell Hammett's greatest novel, so the murder of Hobart Lindsey's partner, Cletus Berry, sets off the quest in The Silver Chariot Killer, the sixth of Richard A. Lupoff's classic series of ""Killer"" mysteries. It's Christmas week in New York and Cletus Berry's body has been found literally frozen in the ice in an alley in Hell's Kitchen, a black circle marking the entry wound of the bullet that scrambled Berry's brain and ended his life. This wouldn’t normally be Lindsey's case, but ""When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it."" Earlier novels in the series built a popular following for Hobart Lindsey and Marvia Plum. Now Lindsey is on his own and on alien turf, and the action grows darker as Lindsey's world grows colder. The Silver Chariot Killer is a case unlike any that Lindsey has faced in the past, and unlike any that the reader is likely to have encountered until now.

In the middle of the last century, the British magazine SCIENCE FANTASY created its own distinctive strains of fantasy narrative, most famously by such writers as Brian W. Aldiss, J. G. Ballard, John Brunner, Michael Moorcock, and Thomas Burnett Swann, among others. This book looks closely at the whole trajectory of that lost magazine, from its birth in 1950 through 1967, when it was briefly called (SF) Impulse. John Boston provides a brilliantly insightful and often every funny account of the rise, evolution, and final fall of SCIENCE FANTASY, its writers, and its quirky editors. Boston is joined by writer and critic Damien Broderick, adding his own waspish and nostalgic comments.

Enthralling and amusing, it's written with affection and wit. This is no dry, modishly theorized academic analysis. Nor is it a rah-rah celebration of the ""Good Old Days."" Here is a candid and astute reader's response to a magazine that, by today's standards, was often comically bad--but was also immensely important in its time, and improved, like the Little Engine (or maybe Starship) That Could. New Worlds is best remembered today as the fountainhead of the New Wave of audacious experimental SF in the second half of the 1960s, under editor Michael Moorcock. But these first pioneering issues, from 1946-59, were edited by the magazine’s founder, John ""Ted"" Carnell (1912-72). Carnell was a pillar of the old-style UK SF establishment, but gamely supportive of innovators--most famously, of the brilliant J. G. Ballard, Brian W. Aldiss, and John Brunner, whose early work he nurtured. The story of how New Worlds got started, survived, and got better is essential to the history of the genres of the fantastic in the UK--and indeed, the world. And huge fun to read. Watch for the companion volumes, New Worlds: Before the New Wave, and Strange Highways, dealing with New World's companion magazine, Science Fantasy.","20130101","Boston, John","Author","Broderick, Damien","Author","","","","","WORLD","","","","4.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Sure, a zombie's bite can turn its victim into one of the living dead. But that's not all.

In his stories, McLaughlin explores many different ways to bring the dead back to life.<P>As you read these stories, you will learn about zombies created by Internet witches, and discover the bizarre secrets of the isle of Zovemba, also known as Zombie Island. And that's not all. To satisfy your hunger for horror, McLaughlin has added sixteen stories about other types of humanoid monstrosities.

<P>
By the time the dog was full-grown, he weighed a good 150 pounds. With his sharp pointed ears and gray coat Barry was constantly mistaken for a timber wolf —so much so, in fact, that even the longhorns on the range attacked him.
<P>
Then came a fierce struggle between the cowhands and a notorious wolf pack, led by Lobo the Black Wolf. Year after year the pack had terrorized and attacked the grazing cattle. It was while tracking them down that Jim shot Barry by mistake. Gun-shy and hurt, the dog took to the timber alone.
<P>
But the range riders were to win their battle in an exciting climax as Barry rushed in to save Jim from the maddened Lobo. The fight was a grizzly one—a fight to the finish—as the two animals fought for their lives on the open range in the black of night.","19380101","Hinkle, Thomas C.","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","25.00","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

Slout, circus historian par excellence, here provides six essays on the development of the American circus. ""From Rags to Ricketts: The Roots of Circus in Early Gotham"" looks at the beginnings of circus entertainment in old New York City during the eighteenth century. ""The Great Roman Hippodrome of 1874: P. T. Barnum's 'Crowning Effort'"" describes the great showman's grand experiment: the collection and display in the Big Apple of the ""largest collection of living wild animals in the world."" ""The Recycling of the Dan Rice Paris Pavilion Circus"" tells the story of an American circus entrepreneur who took his traveling show to Europe in 1867. ""Strange Bedfellows: The Pogey O'Brien Interval, 1874-1875"" relates how O'Brien partnered with P. T. Barnum to take the circus master's show on the road while Barnum was creating his ""Great Roman Hippodrome."" ""Two Rings and a Hippodrome Track"" demonstrates that the first two-ring circus mounted by Barnum (or anyone else) occurred in 1873, and not 1872, as previously supposed. Finally, ""The Adventures of James M. Nixon, Forgotten Impresario,"" describes the career of a major circus manager who worked between the 1843-75, directly competing with Barnum for the same audience--and eventually losing the struggle. Slout’s vivid accounts, highlighted by contemporaneous newspaper accounts of the excitement generated locally by these traveling shows, help bring a long-forgotten era alive again.","20120101","Slout, William L.","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","9.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Any captives who can elude Zaroff, his manservant Ivan, and a pack of hunting dogs for three days is set free. No one has yet lasted that long, although a couple of sailors had come close. Zaroff offers sailors a choice—should they decline to be hunted, they will be handed over to Ivan, who had once been official knouter for The Great White Czar. Rainsford denounces this as barbarism, but has no way out. He reluctantly agrees to be hunted...","19240101","Connell, Richard","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

His revenge intersects in a bloody way with the more conventional romantic plot of a young nobleman who loves the daughter of a political prisoner that the former Chancellor of Norway has held in thrall for many years. The tension ratchets up, culminating in a conflagration à la Samson that seems to anticipate the Grand Guignol movement by nearly a century. The story has the nightmarish logic of a bad dream.

He lived to become one of the greatest of all those who helped tame a savage and unknown land. <P>
In childhood when playing with an axe, Dick lost two fingers and was always called ""Cut-Hand"" by the Native Americans. They knew him as a white man whose word to them was never broken. As a trapper, explorer, buffalo hunter, Indian fighter, and scout, he lived enough adventures for a dozen ordinary men. But he went on to drive a flock of 9,000 sheep over 1,600 miles of desert and mountains to the California gold fields, outwitting Native Americans and bandits on the way, and made a fortune from the venture. With the Colorado gold strike, Dick opened the first store and hotel in Denver, then founded the town of Pueblo. His last great exploit was to blast open the 50-mile Raton Pass between New Mexico and Colorado to establish the first toll road in the west.

Ted and his friend, Nelson, who have just graduated from high school, devote part of their pre-college summer to finding the thief of a set of plans for the new state thruway.<P>
It all began for Ted one day in the office of The Town Crier when a man came in to advertise in the “Lost and Found” column for a missing folder with a peculiar zipper. Later, when it was brought to the office by the finder, Ted, carried away by his desire to demonstrate the splendid service offered by the paper, personally left the folder at the advertiser’s address. It turned out to be an empty house, but Ted had reasons for thinking it was logical to leave it there. However, later when he discovered that the folder really contained plans stolen from the highway department, Ted knew he must find it as quickly as possible.<P>
The quest leads Nelson and him into adventures in several empty houses, into an investigation of the mysteriously ringing telephones, and, finally, to a completely different solution than he or the reader had anticipated. The daily doings in a small-town newspaper office plus a well-plotted story make another satisfying Ted Wilford mystery.""","20190101","Pallas, Norvin","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","25.00","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

These tales were billed “Tommy and Tuppence—A Detective Series by Agatha Christie” and would later be collected as Partners in Crime. “Publicity” would be split into two chapters and renamed “A Fairy in the Flat” (the first section) and “A Pot of Tea” (the second section). One additional story collected in Partners in Crime would be published four years later in Holly Leaves, the annual Christmas special of the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News (December 1928).<P>
The conceit is simple: The Beresfords’ friend Mr Carter, who works for a government intelligence agency, arrives bearing a proposition for the adventurous duo. They are to take over The International Detective Agency, a recently cleaned-out spy stronghold, and pose as the owners so as to intercept any enemy messages coming through. In the meantime Tommy and Tuppence can take on cases as this detective agency, an opportunity that delights the young couple. They employ Albert, a young man introduced in The Secret Adversary, as their assistant at the agency.<P>
The two tackle a series of cases, each mimicking the style of a famous fictional detective of the period, including Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Thorndyke, G.K. Chesterton, A.E.W. Mason, and even Christie's own Hercule Poirot (among others). “Publicity” is in the style of Malcolm Sage, Detective, by Herbert George Jenkins.","20200101","Christie, Agatha","Author","","","","","US","","","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

It covers roughly one year of his life, beginning just before his ninth birthday and describes a full year of farming. It describes in detail the endless chores involved in running the Wilder family farm, all without powered vehicles or electricity. Young as he is, he rises before 5 am every day to milk cows and feedstock. In the growing season, he plants and tends crops; in winter, he hauls logs, helps fill the ice house, trains a team of young oxen, and sometimes—when his father can spare him—goes to school. The novel includes stories of his brother, Royal, and sisters, Eliza Jane and Alice.<P>
“If our country can become great in humility, and can work earnestly to solve its own problems at the same time that it carries its share of world responsibilities, it will be through vision of our children, their integrity and idealism, gained in homes like the home in the ‘Little House’ books.”—The Horn Book<P> 
“Any boy or girl who has access to all the books in the series will be the richer for their first-hand record of pioneer life in the opening West and for their warm-hearted human values.”—The New Yorker<P>

This book provides an elementary introduction to problems of those kinds, and the ways in which they modify the general problems of writing fiction. It also suggests strategies that might enable the problems to be handled constructively and productively. The author has published more than seventy novels in the field, more than twenty short story collections, and more than twenty related works of non-fiction; he has, as the saying goes, been there, done that, and chewed his t-shirt in relevant frustration. 
Robert Reginald says: ""An absolutely first-rate guide to writing fantastic literature. Stableford has much to say that potential writers of ALL fiction might find valuable, interesting, and highly illuminating. His reasonable discussion and dissection of the basic issues facing authors of creative fiction--and the solutions to be found to each problem--are dollops of solid gold advice, in this editor's humble opinion.

Yeleeve, newly sent forth from the School for Singers, encounters, early in her journey, disturbing indications that something is seriously wrong in Tyrnos. Finding along her way such allies as Lisaux of the Black Shield and the Winter Beast, she pursues clues that crop up inexorably, arriving at last at the conclusion that an intrusion by alien beings has corrupted not only the King, but his own Singer of Souls.

It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution.

But the yule holiday has been celebrated for at least two centuries in North America, and our writers have been producing memorable stories about this unique day for almost as long. 
<P>
Here are 25 Christmas stories old and new, tales to delight, to entrance, to beguile, and even to sadden a whole new generation of readers. From Nina Kiriki Hoffman's poignant ""Lazelle Family Christmas"" to Jacob A. Riis's gut-wrenching portrait of the holiday in the 1890s slums of New York to Johnston McCulley's riveting tale of Christmas in the Old West, we experience every possible facet of this most precious day of the year. 
<P>
So sit back and relive your memories once again, as recreated through the eyes of some of the finest writers of their time!

DAY OF THE MINOTAUR


Thomas Burnett Swann (1928 - 1976) was an American poet, critic and fantasy author. The bulk of Swann's fantasy fits into a rough chronology that begins in ancient Egypt around 2500 BC and chronicles the steady decline of magic and mythological races such as dryads, centaurs, satyrs, selkies and minotaurs. The coming of more ""advanced"" civilisations constantly threatens to destroy their pre-industrial world, and they must continually seek refuge wherever they can. They see the advent of Christianity as a major tragedy; the Christians regard magic and mythological beings as evil and seek to destroy the surviving creatures, although some manage to survive and preserve some of their old ways through medieval times down to the late 19th Century and perhaps the 20th.","19710101","Swann, Thomas Burnett","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","3.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Together with H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, Smith was one of the ""Three Musketeers"" of legendary Weird Tales magazine, and contributed some of the most distinctive (and controversial) fantastic fiction to ever appear in Hugo Gernsback's Wonder Stories. His ""City of the Singing Flame"" and ""Vaults of Yoh-Vombis"" are acknowledged classics in the field, but represent only two selections from a career that produced more than one hundred short stories and over five hundred poems. His imagination roamed the exotic realms of Zothique, Poseidonis, and Averoigne, settings for piquant and colorful tales of beauty and death--stories that value image and atmosphere over plot and action, told in a richly ornate prose-style that has won him ardent admirers, and has influenced such writers as Ray Bradbury, Jack Vance, and Bruce Sterling. This Second Edition of the first book-length study of Smith--a substantial examination of his life and works, his artistic evolution and literary heritage--includes a supplementary suite of essays that delve into the most interesting aspects of Smith's fiction, plus Smith's own tale of  Mars, ""Mnemoka,"" unpublished in his lifetime, but resurrected here from the fragments of its burned manuscript. Drawing on unpublished materials and correspondence, and conversations with surviving friends and colleagues, critic Steve Behrends paints a portrait of Clark Ashton Smith as a gifted, stubborn iconoclast, one of the last surviving Romantics in the heyday of Realism--a man born outside his time, whose escape lay in the dream-journeys of his fiction and poetry.","20130101","Behrends, Steve","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","4.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

I have always been interested in Lovecraft the philosopher, and in my Starmont Reader’s Guide to Lovecraft (1982) I attempted a very compressed account of his philosophical views. To treat so complex a thinker as Lovecraft in a few pages was obviously untenable, even though I think those few pages at least convey the unity of his thought -- perhaps better than this fuller study does. One reviewer, however, was correct in noting that I did not sufficiently integrate Lovecraft’s thought and his fiction, and I have now attempted to remedy the failing.<P>
I am still not convinced that I have really written one rather than two books here. Does Lovecraft’s fiction really depend upon his philosophy? I wrestle with this question further in my introduction, but here I can note that I had great difficulty deciding upon the proper structure for this book. I deal with four principal facets of Lovecraft's philosophy -- metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, and politics -- in Part I, and those same facets as applied to the fiction in Part II. It might have made more sense to juxtapose the corresponding chapters of each part, but I finally determined that this would be both methodologically and practically unsound; methodologically for reasons explained in the introduction, and practically because it would fail to demonstrate the interconnectedness of Lovecraft’s thought and because in Part II I frequently rely upon conceptions expressed throughout the whole of Part I.<P>
In Part I, the author deals with four principal facets of Lovecraft's philosophy: metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, and politics. In Part II, he studies those same facets as applied to the fiction.","19900101","Joshi, S.

A word to the sensitive: The 19th and early 20th century used language differently than we do, and characters in these stories sometime use terms which might be considered mild racial slurs today, but not at the time the stories were written. If you are upset by terms such as “redskins” for Native Americans, this is not the right ebook for you. However, if you can look beyond such things, you will find this to be an entertaining, enjoyable set of adventure stories. (And you’ll learn a lot about tying knots!)<P>

In December of 1946 Harry Stephen Keeler wrote a huge novel he called THE ACE OF SPADES MURDER. No publisher would tackle a novel so big so he split it up, eventually making five new novels from it. THE CASE OF THE JEWELED RAGPICKER was the one first published, in 1948 by Phoenix Press. In it, circus driver Bill Chattuck must make his way across Idiots' Valley via Old Twistibus in time to prevent  something horrible from happening.

He published prolifically in most of the top magazines of the day, before settling into an action-adventure niche. From the fiction magazines, he moved into comics (writing for Red Ryder), comic strips (he penned “Chris Welkin, Planeteer” from its start in 1951 into the 1960s), and Big Little books for the Whitman Publishing Company (he wrote at least 60, including the Maximo the Amazing Superman series). All the while, he maintained his full-time job as fiction editor for Scripps-Howard NEA news service. In those days, newspapers published fiction, and many had a weekly insert that included full-length novels.<P>
Although well regarded, his novels—which appeared under pseudonyms—failed to attract much fan attention, and he is largely forgotten today. Nevertheless, modern readers will enjoy his better-than-average writing and fun, action-adventure plots—often with clever twists.<P>

Hanner the Warlock knew his days were numbered. The Calling pulled at him ceaselessly now, and his ability to resist had begun to crumble. So he determined to find a place where the Calling couldn’t reach him . . . another world, located through a magic tapestry. Every warlock knew that the farther he was from Aldagmor, the weaker the Calling was — and the weaker his magic was, as well, but that was only a secondary consideration.  That weakening had given Hanner the idea to find, or make, a place so distant from Aldagmor that the Call couldn’t reach it at all.

Unfortunately, the Call took him anyway. And that’s where his story really gets interesting. Because the Calling wasn’t what everyone believed.

What is Sime~Gen? For those of you who are reading this book without previous experience of this expansive universe here is a brief introduction:<P>
Sime~Gen is a series of novels written by Jacqueline Lichtenberg and Jean Lorrah. It is set in a future where humans have mutated into two subspecies. Simes, who go through a brief but dramatic change at puberty and Gens, whose change, while just as dramatic, is invisible to the naked eye.<P>
The outward sign of the Simes' change is development of tentacles on their forearms, four strong and flexible ""handling"" tentacles and two smaller tentacles just for selyn transfer, called ""laterals."" Gens produce life energy called ""selyn"" which Simes require once a month to live. Unfortunately, the result in obtaining this energy is usually the death of the Gen.<P>
This physical transformation happens just prior to puberty. There is no way of knowing, before that, if a person will be Sime or Gen.<P>
At the chronological beginning of the published novels by Jacqueline, and Jean, a second mutation of Sime emerges. These ""channels"" are able to keep Simes from Killing Gens, thus saving mankind from self-annihilation. The stories that you find here, and the published books by Jacqueline Lichtenberg and Jean Lorrah, explore the role of these new Simes, and the Gens who live side by side with them as humankind struggles to become one again.<P>

Mark—whom I’ve had the pleasure of publishing for nearly 20 years now—is one of those unique voices in the horror field. He doesn’t tread the safe (or even sane!) path, but goes off in quirky directions, and he’s happy to have company along the way. And while he’s poking around the oddest places, he finds humor in the outrageous and the unsettling. Vampires? Of course. Zombies? Definitely. But these are never quite the monsters you’re expecting.
Don’t take my word for it. Here are some other opinions:<P>
“In the most devious manner, McLaughlin’s stories achieve a high degree of demonism by perpetuating a sinister ‘humor’ at the gallows of the human comedy.” (Thomas Ligotti)<P>
“Listen up. Noel Coward is back. Salvador Dali is back. Dylan Thomas is back. And they’re all rolled into one in the shape of Mark McLaughlin who writes stories that are wonderfully witty, surrealistic and ineffably strange. Absolutely fabulous.… If your palette is jaded, come to the feast that is Mark McLaughlin.” (Simon Clark)<P>
“McLaughlin’s tales are laugh-out-loud assaults on consensus reality.” (Paul Di Filippo, ASIMOV’S)<P>
“Reading Mark McLaughlin is a little like stepping out of the door of an airplane in mid flight. The view is pretty amazing, but the shock of impact may do you in...gruesome, funny and touching. Top that: anybody.…” (TANGENT)<P>
So, dig in and enjoy these 28 tales by one of the modern masters of the macabre!<P>

And Hamilton -- known as the author of the ""Captain Future"" series -- was indeed one of the foremost writers of pulp space opera. Over the years, as his work became more polished and sophisticated, he evolved into far more than that: a visionary of the future whose imagination knew no bounds. He was truly a cosmic writer, as stories such as ""Devolution"" (in this collection) demonstrate. If you are interested in pulp science fiction at its pulpiest, look no farther.

A priest-physician like his friend Ephan, Psal lacks a warrior's heart, yet he desires to earn Nahas's respect and become a clan chief. If he cannot do this, he must escape his clan altogether. But his love for Cassia, the daughter of his father's enemy, and his own weaknesses work against him. When war comes, Psal defends Ktwala and her daughter Mahari, wronged by Nahas, and speaks out against the atrocities his clan commits, further jeopardizing his future. And now the mysterious towers that keep humans safe from the Creator's ancient curse are rebelling. A prophecy exists-not that Psal believes such matters-of three great ones who will find the Constant Tower and break the power of the third moon. Could Psal, Ephan, and Mahari be those great ones? Psal must risk losing his father's respect to find his destiny, and with his friends face the dangers of the unmaking night to find the Constant Tower and save all of humanity.<p>

Its main theme is to identify what a sophist is and how a sophist differs from a philosopher and statesman. Because each seems distinguished by a particular form of knowledge, the dialogue continues some of the lines of inquiry pursued in the epistemological dialogue, Theaetetus, which is said to have taken place the day before. Because the Sophist treats these matters, it is often taken to shed light on Plato's Theory of Forms and is compared with the Parmenides, which criticized what is often taken to be the theory of forms.","20180101","Plato","Author","Jowett, Benjamin","Translated by","","","","","WORLD","","","","7.79","NOK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

The play follows the fortunes of several young people, including Marcel (a painter), Musette (his promiscuous lover), Rodolphe (a writer), and Mimi (his faithful but fatally ill companion). Unable to support themselves from their art, they are doomed either to sell out or die of despair and the bad living conditions they're forced to endure. But all remain bright, sympathetic characters full of optimism, despite their lack of commercial success. It's the eternal story of talented youth struggling against a bourgeois society that doesn't appreciate them.

But he is no mere thief...he is the king of his chosen profession, a master ""dip"" who works only in the subways of New York City. Like all such villains, he faces a cunning adversary in Police Detective Craddock, who is always half a pace behind.
Craddock has sworn to put Tham behind bars, where he belongs. But Tham is clever enough to always remain one step ahead of Craddock -- and everyone else.<P>
Despite being a criminal, Tham always comes off well: the people whom he relieves of their wallets are often deserving of it, and he has a tendency to take on other, much worse crooks to give them their just desserts.<P>
And, of course, there are scoundrels aplenty in his world: a rival pickpocket who moves in on his turf in ""Thubway Tham's Baggage Check;"" Shifty Shane, the holdup man, who calls Tham a coward because he doesn't use a gun; and Mr. Clackworthy, a slick grifter from Chicago, who looks down on ""dips"" as the lowest of thieves.<P>
Call him an early antihero. Tham endears himself to readers because he has a moral compass. He knows his place is in the gutter of the world, but that doesn't mean he can't strive to better himself -- or others.<P>

Steinbeck based the novella on his own experiences working alongside migrant farm workers as a teenager in the 1910s (before the arrival of the Okies that he would describe in The Grapes of Wrath). The title is taken from Robert Burns' poem ""To a Mouse"", which reads: ""The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley"". (The best laid schemes of mice and men / Often go awry.)<P>
While it is a book taught in many schools, Of Mice and Men has been a frequent target of censors for vulgarity, and what some consider offensive and racist language; consequently, it appears on the American Library Association's list of the Most Challenged Books of the 21st Century.","20200101","Steinbeck, John","Author","","","","","AE AF AO AW AZ BB BD BH BI BJ BM BN BO BS BT BW BY BZ CA CD CF CG CM CN CO CU CV CY DJ DM DZ ET FM GA GD GM GN GQ GW HK HT ID IN IQ IR JM JO JP KG KH KI KM KN KP KR KW KZ LA LB LC LK LS LY MA MD MH ML MM MN MO MU MV MW MY NA NE NP NR OM RW SC SD SN SR SV SY SZ TD TG TH TJ TL TM TN TO TT TV TW TZ UG UZ VE VN ZA ZM ZW","","","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

William Congreve wrote four comedies: The Way of the World is his acknowledged masterpiece; Love for Love is less brilliant but easier to perform; The Old Bachelor and The Double Dealer, his early dramas, contain very good material but are rarely read let alone performed. Frank Morlock builds his own adaptation of Congreve's dramas on the general plot of Love for Love, and interweaves characters and dialogue from the other plays into and around it. In the process some characters are blended with other characters, and acquire clever dialogue found elsewhere. Almost every line in this drama is Congreve’s. The result is a lively play that keeps Congreve’s best comedic work fresh and vital for a new audience.","19820101","Morlock, Frank J.","Author","Congreve, William","Author","","","","","WORLD","","","","4.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

He made one phone call, and to the bewilderment of his true love, Twit-Twit, and his true friends, Tom and Betsy Dolan, all four found themselves outward bound for Europe on the supposedly sold-out pride of the line. And thereby lies a trail to America's sexiest movie star (Merrilee), her fears of a fate worse than a fate worse than death, her nightmares that literally come true, and a Hollywood conspiracy that could baffle the C.I.A.--all packed into the wittiest, most tightly plotted mysteries of the year!<P>
Herbert Brean was an American journalist and crime fiction writer, best known for his recurring series characters William Deacon and Reynold Frame. He was a director and former executive vice president of the Mystery Writers of America, a group for which he also taught a class in mystery writing. Aside from his seven mystery crime novels, he also published non-fiction books and articles, and mystery magazine short stories. Alfred Hitchcock used one of Brean's many articles for Life Magazine, ""A Case of Identity"" (1953) as the basis for his film The Wrong Man.","19660101","Brean, Herbert","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","3.99","CAD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

And thus, the myth of the Great American Novel was born of a loaded question—would the United States ever produce a work to rival the accepted great works of Western Culture? Many tried. And, in the trying, many looked to model themselves after already extant writers and works which had gained positive notice (as standing on the shoulders of giants has always been one accepted route to success and acceptance). So herein this Megapack, Wildside press offers for you four also-rans of the early to mid 20th Century, four widely varied attempts to grab at that brass ring called The Great American Novel.<P>

Kate had met June at school, and, although four years her senior, had gone out of her way to befriend the forlorn, unattractive, almost ugly girl in her early teens. Now, five years later, the invitation had appeared out of the blue, and Kate found herself a guest in a strange, isolated household of very bohemian ways, with a menacing undercurrent that made Kate very uneasy. Suddenly, things began to happen with astonishing rapidity. Clotilde, June’s beautiful stepsister was kidnapped in very gruesome circumstances, and Kate had to play a nerve-racking part in delivering the ransom money.

But two murders occurred before peace was finally restored in the Gladstone household, and the warped, twisted mind of a murderer was revealed.

As successful writer she is free to return to her mother's farm in Kentucky where she trades in her panty hose and high-heeled shoes for jeans and loafers. Her only problem is the pen name of ""Leonard Paisley"" that her agent encourages her to assume because ""a detective novel will sell better if it's written by a man."" Unfortunately Paisley finds out that every paradise has its snake when her beautiful daughter, Cassie falls, in love with a young epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control.

The playwright focuses on the people inadvertently caught up in the slaughter--which, once started, cannot be repressed. By following the fate of two nobles, the Catholic Count Coconnas and the Huguenot Count de la Mole, and linking their stories to Queen Marguerite (called Margot), wife in name only to the Huguenot King of Navarre (the future King Henry IV of France), Dumas reveals the terror and duplicity that the massacre incurred even at the highest levels of society--including the royal family.

<P>
But the yule holiday has been celebrated for at least two centuries in North America, and our writers have been producing memorable stories about this unique day for almost as long. Here are 29 Christmas stories old and new, tales to delight, to entrance, to beguile, and even to sadden a whole new generation of readers. From C. C. MacApp's view of a Christmas future to Jacob A. Riis's gut-wrenching portraits of the holiday in the 1890s slums of New York to William J. Locke's reenactment of the tale of the Three Wise Men, we experience every possible facet of this most precious day of the year. So sit back and relive your memories once again, as recreated through the eyes of some of the finest writers of their time!

His speaking knowledge of the language was excellent; he could even write and read it sufficient for normal purposes, but since when have legal books been written for the understanding of the common man? And with legal phraseology being what it was, he dared take no chances on hit-or-miss translations. Not when his entire future could depend on the exact meaning of a word.<P>

It all started with a murder 20 years earlier. A ragpicker was found in a closet, stabbed in the back with a jewelled dagger—through an ace of spades! There’s a reward for the solution to this old murder and Bill Chattuck, driver for MacWhorter’s Motorized Circus, must get that reward—and prove the legitimacy of his girl, Melody—or they’ll never get married!

And beside the agents were the great international criminals always drawn by such an affair. The first intimation of the sinister undercurrents North was facing came on the night train in Cuba -- when a drab-looking German was murdered almost before his eyes, with a glass dagger thrust into the heart.

While Flora had a long career writing much crime, mystery, and detective fiction, Marcus seems to be his only attempt to create a series character. Marcus, as a character, is marked by his dogged rationality, as he attempts to solve various “inexplicable” murders and crimes, much to the annoyance of his compatriot Bobo Fuller. We have been able to identify nine stories featuring the character—although as always we ask fans and aficionados to inform us of any we have missed. Note: while many online sources list the Fletcher Flora story “The Capsule” (from Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine, December 1964) as being part of the Marcus series, it does not actually feature the character. “The Capsule” can be read in Wildside Press’s The Second Fletcher Flora Mystery MEGAPACK®.<P>

His considerable output is now largely forgotten, even among aficionados of weird and mystery fiction. This book collects thirty-one of Favenc's best stories, many published here for the first time since their original publication; and aims to showcase Favenc's talent as the most important Australian colonial writer of Gothic and supernatural fiction.

He achieved early local recognition, largely through the enthusiasm of George Sterling, for traditional verse in the vein of Swinburne. As a poet, Smith is grouped with the West Coast Romantics (alongside Ambrose Bierce, Joaquin Miller, Sterling, Nora May French, and others) and remembered as 'The Last of the Great Romantics' and 'The Bard of Auburn.' As a member of the Lovecraft circle, (Smith’s literary friendship with H. P. Lovecraft lasted from 1922 until Lovecraft's death in 1937), Smith remains second only to Lovecraft in general esteem and importance amongst contributors to the pulp magazine Weird Tales, where some readers objected to his morbidness and violation of pulp traditions. (It has been said of him that ""Nobody since Poe has so loved a well-rotted corpse."") His work is marked chiefly by an extraordinarily wide and ornate vocabulary, a cosmic perspective and a vein of sardonic and sometimes ribald humour.

""The Death of Ilalotha"" is one of Smith's classic weird fantasies, originally published in Weird Tales magazine (September, 1937).","20140101","Smith, Clark Ashton","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","0.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

She also wrote fantasy, historical, and western books and picture-books for younger readers, such as ""The Billy Goat in the Chili Patch"", ""A Totem for Ti-Jacques"", and ""Rattlesnake Run.""<P>
In ""The Gismo,"" Jerry Cole finds a mysterious device -- which he calls a ""gismo"" for lack of a better term -- that turns out to be of alien origin. It was lost by a spaceship, and the aliens’ leader, Monaal, needs it to communicate with his people. Will Jerry be able to return it, or will the adults prevent it...and ruin our first contact with Monaal’s people?<P>
In ""The Gismonauts,"" the action jumps farther into the future, with Jerry Cole’s grandson, Chris, encountering an alien way station set up by Monaal and his people on the moon.  Monaal is still studying Earth. Can Chris keep the aliens’ secret and prove humanity is ready to join the galactic Federation?<P>
In ""A Message from Monaal,"" the aliens have a last test for humanity, and Chris may be the only one who can prove we are ready for galactic citizenship!<P>
“The Gismo and its sequels are not well known beyond a generation of American kids who found them in their school classrooms and libraries. They were published for the educational market and were designed to be read by 4th to 8th grade readers in the 1970s and 1980s. (Am I dating myself if I admit to reading--and loving--The Gismo in school?) I don’t think any copies were sold commercially.

Here he gives us a brand-new webwork of mysteries -- a cracksman who uses not dynamite, but a violin; a second-hand safe with amazing secrets inside; a volcanic island in the Pacific; a fantastic kingdom in Europe; and a pair of lovers caught in the very center of this whirlwind of danger and detection. As usual, this breathless yarn is filled with facts and incidents undreamed of in the usual mystery story. Keeler fans will find it a special treat.

His heavy shoulders drooped from fatigue. His eyes were large and dark and there was weary compassion in them as if they had looked upon the thousand faces of human life, neither with despair nor hope, but only with a patient acceptance.

Unique in his talent, his novels dealt not with the far future, but with the enigma of the past. Prior to the dawn of human history, the Earth did not belong solely to humanity -- there were other intelligent species still fighting a last-stand battle against extinction.Remembered today only in legend, these are creatures of the trees and water, beings that combined beast and man, with strange lore of their own and sciences lost to the human victors.<P>

GREEN PHOENIX is a tour de force of the final stronghold of the prehumans against the last legion of fallen Troy.

Victorian-era literary magazines and newspapers often ran fiction without crediting the author, or with only vague terms like ""A Lady,"" initials, or humorous pseudonyms (as with the story by “Q.E.D.” in this volume). Authors later collected their stories in books, and that's when readers discovered who had actually written what. If a story never got reprinted, its author remained a mystery.

Once there, he discovers she has knifed a semi-famous actor to death “in self defense” and needs Harley’s help to clean things up to protect her from scandal. His affection for the actress is too strong to refuse and he ends up burying the corpse along with it's belongings. Of course as he is digging the grave, we know he is actually digging himself deeper and deeper into a world of blackmail, disloyalty, and hunted persecution.","19420101","Ford, Leslie","Author","Brown, Zenith","Author","","","","","WORLD","","","","7.99","AUD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

We hope you will enjoy the stories we have selected for you this time. There's a greater emphasis than usual on Golden Age writers (just the way it came together) -- but we have one original story as well, a posthumous collaboration with H.B. Fyfe, finishing a really terrific but not-quite-done tale he had been working on before his death. It's a bit reminiscent of James Tiptree, Jr.'s best work -- but predates Tiptree by a couple of decades. And we have novels by Robert Silverberg, Frederik Pohl & C.M. Kornbluth, Murray Leinster, E. Everett Evans, and Donald Wollheim...not to mention part 2 of our serialization of Tony Rothman's mammoth 2013 novel, Firebird. And a ton of great short stories. 36 works in all, more than 1900 pages of great reading!<P>

And did Lily Klimpton kill herself after her lover’s death, or did she die at the hands of another? In Found Dead, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson return to unravel two mysterious tales by the devious Lyn McConchie.
Local squire’s daughter Miss Bibiana Paget befriends the ailing Collin Melrose, who lives near her family’s estate. Melrose does not have long to live, so Miss Bibi isn’t shocked when she visits his cottage and discovers him dead. Yet why would a man who couldn’t walk unaided be sitting in a chair that was not his favorite, the one he always sat in? Something is very wrong, and Miss Bibi consults Holmes and Watson. Can they untangle the knotted threads of Melrose’s past and expose a killer?
<P>
In their second case, Holmes and Watson visit the Isle of Sheppey to investigate Lily Klimpton’s death. Was it suicide, as everyone but her family believes, or was she murdered? And is her death related to that of Alistair Johnson, her erstwhile employer and paramour? Holmes and Watson’s investigations uncover a far deeper evil than they first suspected—but can they prevent more deaths and capture those responsible?","20190101","McConchie, Lyn","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","25.00","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

<P>
In the old days, vampires were sexy, ruthless, and evil.  They could, and would, compel the living to do whatever they wanted. They owned the night. Unfortunately, being undead in modern times has unexpected and disturbing challenges.
<P>
Now nine authors take an amused, and sometimes grim look at the problems some vampires face in the twenty-first century. In ""Thin White Duke in Sneakers,"" a newly turned environmental activist and confirmed vegan has some serious issues with his politically incorrect vampire diet. Family life is disrupted in ""Uncle Dmitri"" when the police suddenly want to know what kindly Uncle Dmitri might be doing at night besides driving a cab. A young artist in ""Take My Breath Away"" desperately seeks a real vampire to turn her into an immortal only to discover she will still need to get a job to pay her rent. In ""The Face on the Coin,"" unlife is complicated by obsession, a vampire ghost, and time travel. ""Farmer"" is a tale of the far-future where humans may well be hunted off the face of the Earth. ""Sunrise Decision"" is the compelling story of a young marine in Fallujah who can only stop a murderous predator by making his own, personal life and death decision. In ""They Shall Take Up Serpents,"" a predatory Revivalist preacher is brought to justice by a vampire and a cage full of snakes.  In ""Sale Season,"" intrigue and vampire romance haunt the art galleries of Europe while ""Cursed Blood"" asks the eternal question: Do you always have to bite the one you love?
<P>
These authors were inspired to write by various TV shows, from Star Trek, Forever Knight, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (& Angel) to White Collar, Burn Notice, Vampire Diaries, Being Human, etc. and have made the leap from fanfiction to professional writing.

Du Bois was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.<P>
Du Bois was a prolific author. His collection of essays, The Souls of Black Folk, is a seminal work in African-American literature; and his 1935 magnum opus, Black Reconstruction in America, challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks were responsible for the failures of the Reconstruction Era. Borrowing a phrase from Frederick Douglass, he popularized the use of the term color line to represent the injustice of the separate but equal doctrine prevalent in American social and political life. He opens The Souls of Black Folk with the central thesis of much of his life's work: ""The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.""","20200101","Du Bois, W.E.B.","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

In fact, if he has thought sufficiently on the subject, he will have seen that the entire process of selling goods, personally, or by means of advertising or display, is essentially a mental process depending upon the state of mind induced in the purchaser, and that these states of mind are induced solely by reason of certain established principles of psychology. Whether the salesman, or advertiser, realizes this or not, he is employing psychological principles in attracting the attention, arousing the interest, creating the desire, and moving the will of the purchaser of his goods.

One day, while delivering an unusual musical instrument to a hamlet high in the mountains, he is thrown by his horse during a storm. Temporarily lame, he is forced to take refuge in a strange cabin in the forest, where the mysterious Melusine lived with her daughter Lucinia. When Alastor returns to the town, he takes Lucinia with him and marries her. They have two children, Handsel and Chanterelle. Everything goes well with the family until disaster strikes, leaving Catrianne in sole charge of the children, obliged to seek shelter first at the iron-master’s foundry and then at the cabin in the mountains, where a great many surprises await them regarding their own identity and the peril overhanging the forest and the world of Faerie, which is under threat of extinction. Perhaps something can be saved, and if it can, the key to its salvation might lie, at least in part, in Catrianne’s music, Handsel’s uniqueness, and Chanterelle’s dreams.","19620101","Miller, Albert G.","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","25.00","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

But these were not the harmless, happy-ending lands of film and fable. The sweat and blood was real, and the horrors they faced genuinely dangerous. One world was a world of magic, ruled by a dark force called Shadow. A handful of would-be heroes resisted Shadow's dominion, and sought assistance in their desperate struggle to free their homeland. The other reality was a universe of spaceships and rayguns, dominated by a Galactic Empire that saw Shadow as a threat -- and that demanded the exiles from our world aid them in their campaign.

In front of the town’s blacksmith shop a group of Mormon homesteaders gather about their potential leader, Webb Nichols, in grave discussion. In a lodge room the special meeting of the Magdalena Stockmen’s Association, comprising the big cow outfits of the county, has turned into a deluge of hot words and very pointed accusations. Is the long conflict between the homesteaders and the big outfits about to flare into violence again?<P>
For years this particular part of Arizona has been a rustler’s paradise. And as long as homesteaders like Webb Nichols and Shad Caney cover up for the rustlers, the notorious Steve Jennings among them, they’re asking for trouble from the big cattlemen. The Association decides to bring matters to a head by calling in Clay Roberts, a lone wolfer stock-detective with a reputation for getting results.
“It don’t seem like one man could make much hell for us,’’ says Webb Nichols, but in that thought Webb, as he is soon to discover, couldn’t be more wrong.<P>
Clay Roberts has a couple of strikes on him from the beginning in Deputy Sheriff Dufors, a weak and embittered tool of the homesteaders, and in Webb and Shad, whose bitter, unreasoning feud is carried on by their children during school hours. These youthful hatreds make life miserable for the pretty new teacher, Eudora Stoddard, who is startled one day to find herself sheltering the head of the rustlers, Steve Jennings.<P>
From then on matters get tougher by the minute. Men who should be seeing eye to eye regard one another with cold hostility, the grisly episode at Parley Scott’s takes place, the rustlers move in on one of the big cowmen and Clay heads for the hills in deadly pursuit, only to find himself forced to save the life of the dangerous rustler he is hired to capture. And that is only the beginning of new trouble for the fearless stock-detective, the cattlemen, and pretty Eudora Stoddard, whom Clay had hoped to make his wife.","20190101","Lomax, Bliss","Author","Drago, Harry Sinclair","Author","","","","","WORLD","","","","25.00","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

Crime, criminals, and their prosecution and punishment, have, from the day Cain slew Abel and the Supreme Law Enforcer dealt with the first fratricide, provoked the interest, aroused the passions, and puzzled the minds of men. Because tales of dark deeds are quick to catch attention and stark sensationalism is easily marketable, accuracy, which is always essential, no longer seems required. So much that we read, hear, and view is blatantly false and misleading, not only as fiction but as alleged truth, that almost universally there is an unwholesome, blurred, and distorted conception of the whole subject of law enforcement. That picture will perhaps never be clarified, unless the public becomes more knowingly critical, and irresponsible merchants of what is banal and lurid grow more scrupulously dependable.","19610101","Frank, Martin M.","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","25.00","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

Edgar Rice Burroughs is most famous for Tarzan of the Apes, and Johnston McCulley is best known as the creator of Zorro, for example. And, of course, we have some series entries -- ""The African Fish Mystery,"" by James Holding, is part of his Leroy King series (a sendup of Ellery Queen), and John Gregory Betancourt's ""Pit and the Princess"" is part of his Peter ""Pitbull"" Geller series.

Torn from the protective community of American missionaries in China, young, innocent teenager Lydia Holt has no idea of the harsh realities she will soon face. Forced into a loveless marriage to a sadistic Chinese nobleman, Lydia escapes her cruel confines and flees to San Francisco, only to meet the man she once trusted with her life--a man who now threatens to destroy the cosmetics empire she has established and rules with an iron hand.

For in the secret corner of her heart, lovely Lydia harbors a dream--the unfulfilled promise of a passion that burned all too briefly for a handsome Scots trader with the blackest of souls. A man who tempted her with his fiery kisses, then left her broken-hearted and betrayed. A man who would one day learn that Lydia's love was far stronger than his lust...could she but find her way back into his arms again.

The author writes: ""Between February and May of 1942, German U-boats operated with impunity off the Florida coast, sinking nearly two dozen freighters from Cape Canaveral to Key West and killing five thousand people. Residents were horrified witnesses of the attacks—the night skies were aflame and in the morning the beaches were covered with oil and tar, ship parts and charred corpses. The Germans even landed teams of saboteurs charged with disrupting war efforts in the factories of the North. This novel is based on those events. For my own purposes, I set the tale in the fictitious town of Juno Beach on the banks of the equally fictitious Seminole River—all in the very real Palm Beach County, a veritable wilderness in those long ago days.

He joined the army at age 21 and was a war correspondent during the Second Boer War, for Reuters and the Daily Mail. Struggling with debt, he left South Africa, returned to London, and began writing thrillers to raise income, publishing books including The Four Just Men (1905). Drawing on his time as a reporter in the Congo, covering the Belgian atrocities, Wallace serialised short stories in magazines such as The Windsor Magazine and later published collections such as Sanders of the River (1911). He signed with Hodder and Stoughton in 1921 and became an internationally recognised author.<P>
After an unsuccessful bid to stand as Liberal MP for Blackpool (as one of David Lloyd George's Independent Liberals) in the 1931 general election, Wallace moved to Hollywood, where he worked as a script writer for RKO studios. He died suddenly from undiagnosed diabetes, during the initial drafting of King Kong (1933).<P>
Wallace was such a prolific writer that one of his publishers claimed that a quarter of all books sold in England were written by him. As well as journalism, Wallace wrote screen plays, poetry, historical non-fiction, 18 stage plays, 957 short stories, and over 170 novels (12 in 1929 alone). More than 160 films have been made of Wallace's work. He is remembered for the creation of King Kong, as a writer of 'the colonial imagination', for the J. G. Reeder detective stories, and for The Green Archer serial. He sold over 50 million copies of his combined works in various editions, and The Economist describes him as ""one of the most prolific thriller writers of [the 20th] century.""<P>

The case appears lost until Roger's approached by a sleazy lawyer who promises him success--but only if he marries a woman sight unseen. Sylvandire, his new wife, turns out to be a stunning beauty, but the marriage is intended to deliver his spouse as the unwilling mistress of a royal favorite, who can imprison Roger if he resists.

A series of crimes surrounding and deriving from a bank robbery that offered a juicy opportunity for the boss comprises the case that must be cracked in this mystery. Its intricate coalition between crime and politics is a miniature of large scale metropolitan evil.   The only opposition not cowed by the power of the boss is a lone private detective. He had previously helped the police solve many a baffling case. Now his only ally is a man whom he was engaged to shadow. The detective must not only be smart enough to out-think the criminals, but also shrewd, quick, and fearless enough to outmaneuver the boss and his well-oiled machine.","19360101","Leitfred, Robert H.","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","25.00","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

Instruction is provided in three forms: (1) resident, (2) correspondence, and (3) traveling lecture teams. The base for all three types of instruction is the same.
<p>
Experience attests to the great value of the correspondence course. The subject matter is presented in small volumes for convenience, each volume representing a major division of the subject. They are reorganized and revised from time to time to bring them up to date and to place emphasis as change may dictate upon those phases of the course deemed most important. Considerable background and illustrative materials are included as a basis for broad and comprehensive education in the field of world resources and their use in support of national objectives.
<p>
The texts consist of materials written by members of the faculty of the Industrial College, of selected lectures delivered at the College, and of selections from various publications. The texts in use were prepared mainly by the Correspondence Text Committee of the Education Division of the College. Current revisions of these texts are prepared by the Branches of the Education Division and coordinated by the Committee, which consists of Dr. Benjamin H. Williams, Chairman, Dr. Harold J. Clem, Dr. Louis C. Hunter, Dr. Andrew J. Kress, and Dr. Samuel H. McGuire. Suggestions and recommendations are based on the instructional policy of the Correspondence Study Branch as well as on student reactions to text materials.
<p>
The Industrial College owes a debt of gratitude to a number of lecturers, writers, and publishers who have permitted the use of their materials in this series of texts. Specific acknowledgments are made in each volume for these contributions.","19540101","Industrial College of the Armed Forces","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","1.95","INR","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Web PDF"

Even so, when they met at university in the 1980s they formed a close friendship, which even survived a crisis point when the reckless Jimmy, having persuaded the sober Mark to sit with him and look after him while he experiments with LSD, accidentally slashed his friend’s face with a scalpel. While Mark settled down to teach history at his old school, Jimmy took his biochemical expertise to Big Pharma, where he eventually ended up as a specialist in ethnomedicine, searching the pharmacopeias of primitive tribes in search of exploitable medicines. Periodically, however, he has popped up again to disturb Mark’s quiet life, always trying to convince him that his latest method of obtaining drug-assisted access to visions of “hyperreality” will finally lead to success. The latest of those attempts, in 2016, promises to be more ambitious than its predecessors, and also far more complicated, involving both Jimmy’s current girl-friend and Mark’s wife in an experiment that threatens to change all their lives, as well as revealing discomfiting truths about the true nature of the universe.","20180101","Stableford , Brian","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","25.00","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

In this thought-provoking work set in the near future and first published in 2007, Spinrad (Raising Hell) traces the course of his protagonist’s life from naive youth to veteran soldier... At its core, the book is about a young man struggling with his faith and the politics that are rightly or wrongly attached to that faith, and his choices feel plausible even to readers who would make very different ones. -- Publishers Weekly, Starred Review<P>
OSAMA THE GUN, set in a not-so-far future when the ""Sons of Osama"" have established a powerful Islamic Caliphate with Pakistani nuclear weapons and Arabian oil money, is the story of one of those ""sons"" of the martyr, a naive and sincere young man who becomes a Caliphate secret agent to escape its closed confines and see the world -- and finds himself becoming the reluctant hero of the title.<P>
Osama the Gun becomes a terrorist leader on a small scale by happenstance, a mercenary used by Islamic forces fighting an American proxy invasion in the oil lands of Nigeria, an iconic figure in the manner of ""El Che."" All the while he charms the reader as a likable, sincere, idealistic, and sympathetic human doing very unsympathetic things to the interests of the United States of America.<P>
""I wanted the reader to hate the sin, but love the sinner, because I felt it had to be done, and since no one else seemed to be willing to do it, I had to try to do it myself, come what may. Because Islam was being confused with its radical Middle Eastern jihadhis, and Arabs in general with terrorists, and it seemed to me that the alien jihadhist consciousness had to be experienced from within and empathetically understood. Which was why OSAMA THE GUN had to be written, and why, as one foaming at the mouth rejection letter predicted, no American publisher would touch this book."" -- Norman Spinrad<P>","20160101","Spinrad, Norman","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","29.99","NOK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

It relishes oddities, even when it piles on fear and dystopian loathing. The technical term for a fascination with the strange and alien is xenophilia, just as the term for a terror of the strange is xenophobia. At its core, then, science fiction is...Xeno Fiction. So science fiction seeks out the strange, roams far from home in space and time, looks with avid eagerness upon the ways of the Others, human or alien. It participates, in brilliantly lighted imagination, in their strange lives. In this second gathering from Van Ikin's critical journal, Science Fiction: A Review of Speculative Literature, writers of the alien are investigated with wit and insight. G. Travis Regier follows the Other into its own home, accompanying those experts in the alien, C. J. Cherry and Samuel R. Delany. In the book's long key essay, Terry Dowling pursues the Art of Xenography as exemplified by Jack Vance's ""General Culture"" novels. Three expert commentators look into Booker Prize-winner Peter Carey's postcolonial and postmodern frolics into alternative realities. And the Xeno fictions of Isaac Asimov, Greg Egan, Mary Gentle, Ursula K. Le Guin, Naomi Mitchison, Neal Stephenson, and Stanley Weinbaum are read as their road maps into the strange.

The principal character is a real person: Bernard Palissy, master potter, craftsman, writer, researcher and lecturer who lived from 1510 to 1589. Many of his glazed pottery masterpieces can be found today in the Louvre and other major museums around the world. This is a story which vividly describes the customs of that time and how Palissy and his family were drawn into one of the bloodiest chapters of French history. The French author closely followed events as described in Palissy’s own autobiography which provides the reader with a real insight into the challenges of that period.

While there, he read a newspaper article on a Chinese detective named Chang Apana. Apana would become the model for Charlie Chan in Biggers' 1925 novel, ""The House Without a Key,"" and there quickly followed five more Charlie Chan novels. Fifty Candles -- first published just two years after that 1919 vacation -- shows how Hawaii, China, and murder had already begun to come together in Biggers' imagination. The story starts in a courthouse in Honolulu, moves to China, then to fog-shrouded San Francisco. Many of the elements used in the Charlie Chan series are present: Chinese characters (both sinister and sympathetic), the Honolulu legal system, a shrewd detective (in this case, the lawyer Mark Drew rather than a policemen), and a baffling murder complete with red herrings and plenty of suspects. This special edition includes John Betancourt's introduction from the 2001 paperback edition, plus a bonus short story, ""The Way to the Island"" -- a long-lost Earl Derr Biggers tale!","20110101","Biggers, Earl Derr","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","0.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

There is also a distinct connection with <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>, in the kidnapping of girls theme, and in that the story concludes in the atmosphere of the lunatic's confinement (and possible recovery), and the villain of the story is his keeper.

A sensitive person who has seen too much misery, he suppresses his memories of the past in order to fully live only in present, trying to do as much good as he can. When he meets another person with similar abilities, but who is completely malevolent, Barash is forced to flee and learn who he really is--only to find that the past may not be what it seems.

Consciously or unconsciously, our feelings about almost everything are largely molded by ready-made opinions and attitudes fostered by our mass methods of communication. 
<P>
Self-hypnosis is a highly suggestible state wherein the individual can direct suggestions to himself. It is a powerful tool in any therapeutic process, and highly motivated subjects can parallel the success of hetero-hypnosis through their own efforts. Self-hypnosis can be used as a palliative agent and can even afford lasting results in many areas of the organism. Self-hypnosis can alleviate distressing symptoms, substitute strong responses for weak responses, help overcome bad habits, create good habits and help one’s power of concentration. The total personality is eventually changed to the point where it can function adequately in an increasingly difficult environment. 
<P>
In learning self-hypnosis, the subject does not relinquish control of himself as is commonly believed. Actually, more control is gained. Self-sufficiency and self-confidence are inevitable results.","19630101","Powers, Melvin","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","0.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

It is not hard to imagine that you are a thirteen-year-old (almost fourteen) and you don’t quite feel like you belong in your own family, with a somewhat goofy father who does magic tricks and disappears for long periods of time and might be a secret agent, not to mention a mother who might be a white witch, and a sister is actually normal but doesn't look the slightest bit like you. Then it gets worse when your family suddenly moves into a massive pile of a house deep in the woods in the middle of nowhere, and that house seems to be alive. It is more than a house. It is also a centuries-old, sleeping dragon that settled into the shape of a house as it slept. But now it is waking up, and you find you have a strange affinity to it. 
<P>
You, and no one else, can slide through the walls, swim in the bloodstream of the Dragon and share its consciousness. You acquire a mysterious teacher and a robotic companion from the planet Zarconax, and if life isn’t getting strange enough already, something goes wrong and Ghastly Horrors and other malevolent monstrosities attack, well before you, or your parents, or even the house itself is prepared to do anything about it. Imagine that an all-encompassing darkness threatens everyone you ever cared about.
<P>
Darrell Schweitzer’s fourth novel might be considered a book for younger readers, or for readers who remember what it was like to be young. It is perhaps most comparable to the spooky narratives of John Bellairs. It is the sort of story, filled with striking imagery and bizarre incidents, a mixture of whimsy and genuine fright.
<P>
The author’s other novels include The White Isle, The Shattered Goddess, and The Mask of the Sorcerer. He has published hundreds of short stories. His fiction has been nominated for the World Fantasy Award three times and once for the Shirley Jackson Award. He is an expert on H.P. Lovecraft and a former editor of the legendary Weird Tales magazine.

“This is the house I should have grown up in!  Schweitzer’s fantasy is cleanly written, original, and great fun to read.”
-- Michael Swanwick, author of The Iron Dragon’s Daughter.
 
“Schweitzer is a story-teller, by whose smoky fire one may sit spell-bound.”

You struggle up the hill, help clear the underbrush, and fell the trees to build huts and fortifications. You endure the cold and the hunger, the sickness and the boredom, the lack of the most rudimentary conveniences, and you marvel at the spirit that keeps your fellow Americans from deserting.<P>
In contrast, you see the relative luxury of the circumstances enjoyed by the British troops in Philadelphia.<P>
Then you see the start of the moves that will ultimately result in victory: the near disruption of the British fleet at Philadelphia by the world’s first submarine and floating mines; experienced foreign officers joining the American cause; the drilling of troops for effective combat, and the declaration of war by France.

I have chosen to release this volume under this particular pseudonym since 5 of the 6 volumes were first published under it. (She published the first book as by “Gordon Daviot,” a name she primarily used for plays with historical themes.)<P>
In five of six novels in this series, the hero is Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant. (Grant appears in a sixth, The Franchise Affair, as a minor character—but it is included here for completeness.) The most famous of these is The Daughter of Time, in which Inspector Grant, while laid up in hospital, has friends research reference books and contemporary documents so that he can puzzle out the mystery of whether King Richard III of England murdered his nephews, the Princes, in the Tower.<P>
The Daughter of Time was the last of Tey’s books to be published during her lifetime. In 1990, the British Crime Writers’ Association selected it as the greatest mystery novel of all time. One final crime novel, The Singing Sands, was found in her papers and published posthumously. It is last in this collection.<P>

The son of a World War II American pilot and a brave French resistance fighter, he grew up on both sides of the Atlantic -- though he prefers his sun-dappled villa on the Riviera to most other places. He takes pleasure in a fine wine...and a good gun. His French name is Pierre-Ange, and it suits him. In English, it means Stone Angel.<P>
When Pete drops by his friend Frank Crowley's house one evening, neither Crowley nor his wife Nathalie is home. Instead, Pete finds two dead bodies -- and he recognizes both. One is a rival private eye. The other is Nathalie's gorgeous sister-in-law, Anne-Marie. Both are naked, with bullet holes in their heads. Were the two having an affair? Is there a connection between the murders and recent goings-on at the prestigious couture house where Anne-Marie was a star designer? Pete Sawyer must keep his wits about him -- and his gun in hand -- to solve this stylish mystery and keep his friend Crowley out of jail....<P>

Obeying the immemorial custom, the lord sends his son Alveric to fetch the King of Elfland's daughter, Lirazel, to be his bride. He makes his way to Elfland, where time passes at a rate far slower than the real world, and wins her. They return to Erl and have a son, but in the manner of fairy brides of folklore, she fits uneasily with his people. She returns to the waiting arms of her father in Elfland, and her lovesick husband goes searching for her, abandoning the kingdom of Erl and wandering in a now-hopeless quest. However, Lirazel becomes lonesome for her mortal husband and son. Seeing that she is unhappy, the King of Elfland uses a powerful magic to engulf the land of Erl. Erl is transformed into a part of Elfland, and Lirazel and her loved ones are reunited forever in an eternal, enchanted world.","19240101","Dunsany, Lord","Author","","","","","AE AF AO AW AZ BB BD BH BI BJ BM BN BO BS BT BW BY BZ CA CD CF CG CM CN CO CU CV CY DJ DM DZ ET FM GA GD GM GN GQ GW HK HT ID IN IQ IR JM JO JP KG KH KI KM KN KP KR KW KZ LA LB LC LK LS LY MA MD MH ML MM MN MO MU MV MW MY NA NE NP NR OM RW SC SD SN SR SV SY SZ TD TG TH TJ TL TM TN TO TT TV TW TZ UG UZ VE VN ZA ZM ZW","","","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

R. James, was an English medieval scholar and provost of King's College, Cambridge (1905–1918), and of Eton College (1918–1936). He is best remembered for his ghost stories, which are regarded as among the best in the genre. James redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal Gothic cliches of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings. However, James's protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests. Accordingly, he is known as the originator of the ""antiquarian ghost story.""

That magical name conjures up all that is thrilling and exciting about the classic mystery short story. The Great Detective, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is without doubt the most well-known and popular fictional character ever created--and with good reason. Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories are fascinating excursions into scientific detection with interesting, well-formed characters, offering intelligent, thoughtful mysteries that all men and women can relate to--and enjoy. Quite simply, Doyle created magic with his Sherlock Holmes stories. 

Writers over the last hundred years have been desperately trying to capture and recreate that magic, and I feel that the authors in this book have done just that. Here are a dozen well-crafted stories (nine of them original to this book) by writers whose love of the original Holmes stories clearly show in their work. So sit back in your comfortable chair and let the fog of old Victorian London swirl around you. Once again, the game is afoot!

Gonji's embattled, vampire-haunted flight brings him to the magnificent walls of Vedun, fabled and accursed city in the escarpments of the Carpathians, only to find the town vanquished and occupied by mercenaries and monsters, demons and foul sorcery, under the command of the storied, invincible King Klann.

This is just the first of many battles that will imperil loyal friends, comrades, and loved ones in a violent combat to restore universal free will and self-determination, to consign unchained supernatural menace to its foul curling place, to restore honor, faith and love to a world of enslavement and chaos.

Of course, this money must be invested to provide for their future. Why? Because the boys must now go straight. Their notoriety from previous adventures now makes it impossible for them to continue as scammers.<P>
The trouble is, they can’t agree on an investment.<P>
Stan impulsively dumps his half of the money into Elysian Pavilion, a drug-and-alcohol rehab house. He wants Glen to do the same, but Glen wants to open a trendy mezcal bar.<P>
An impassable roadblock looms before Glen in the form of the state’s chief liquor distributor, Oskar Stoltz, and his scary flunky, Doug McClatchy. Stoltz hates mezcal and won’t carry it.<P>
Glen’s plan seems permanently stymied . . . until he meets three vital people: Trevor Yorn, young rich trustafarian with a handy venue to host parties. Araceli Zavala, a young Mexican-American woman with mythic resonance. And Fulgencio Pérez, Araceli’s visiting uncle from Mexico, who happens to be a maestro mezcalero, distiller supreme.<P>
All the pieces fall into place for a boutique mezcal distillery and a weekly rave, by which Glen will fulfill his dreams and get rich.<P>
But the enmity of Stoltz and McClatchy has not abated. Danger, death, and destruction lie in the shadows—leading inexorably toward a final, apocalyptic confrontation!<P>

Hoch was and is the undisputed master of the mystery short story. His total output of published short fiction hovers just under 1,000 stories (estimates are in the neighborhood of 960 stories). Hoch (pronounced ""Hoke"") is best remembered for his fair-play and impossible crime short stories, particularly the series featuring Dr. Sam Hawthorne, a small-town physician who unraveled seemingly impossible ""problems"" in 1920s New England. His other popular series characters included British Intelligence codebreaker Jeffrey Rand and thief-for-hire Nick Velvet.<P>
While a vast majority of Ed Hoch's stories were mysteries, he enjoyed horror and science fiction. Of his nine-hundred-plus output, he wrote several handfuls of horror and science fiction stories that appeared in various magazines and anthologies. It could be argued that his first published story, ""Village of the Dead"" (which appeared in the December 1955 issue of the pulp magazine Famous Detective Stories), is as much horror as it is a mystery. In that story, the mass suicide of an entire village is investigated by Simon Ark, a mysterious—possibly two-thousand year old—Coptic Priest.<P>

The Earth colony sent to tame the world has failed, at least in the terms expected of it, and seems beyond redemption; but the crew of the Daedalus still has to find out exactly why and how the program has gone wrong. Provided, of course, that they can survive the investigation itself!","20120101","Stableford, Brian","Author","","","","","AD AE AF AL AM AN AO AQ AR AS AT AW AX AZ BA BB BE BF BG BH BI BJ BL BO BQ BR BV BY CA CC CD CF CG CH CI CK CL CM CN CO CR CU CV CW CX CZ DE DJ DK DO DZ EC EE EH ER ES ET FI FM FO FR GA GD GE GF GG GH GI GL GM GN GP GQ GR GS GT GU GW HM HN HR HT HU ID IM IR IS IT JE JP KG KH KI KM KP KR KZ LA LB LI LR LT LU LV LY MA MC MD ME MF MG MH MK ML MN MO MP MQ MR MS MV MX NC NE NF NI NL NO NU OM PA PE PF PH PL PM PR PS PT PW PY QA RE RO RS RU SE SI SJ SK SM SN SR SS ST SV SX SY TC TD TF TG TH TJ TK TL TM TN TO TW UA UM US UY UZ VA VE VI VN WF YT","","","","","","15.99","DKK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

In a decadent and caste-based future, humanity is divided into guilds, each having a specific job to do.

Along with a young Flier girl and a Changeling (who belongs to no guild), he visits the old city of Roum (suspected previously to be called Rome), and becomes entangled in events including the possibility of invasion.","19680101","Silverberg, Robert","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

THE RULE OF THE BRAINS...
<P>
After many years spent in wars and struggle, mankind had achieved a perfect civilization. But this Utopia was going directly against the adaptive strain Nature had developed.
<P>
In earlier times, the human body had been keyed to respond to every emergency. Now it was trying to find a new form of excitation in order to maintain its equilibrium, was seeking to tear down that perfect structure... So mankind’s rulers built the Arbiter, an artificial intelligence created from the brains of twelve men and women, who had sacrificed their lives for the greater good.
<P>
The pooled intelligence of the Arbiter’s twelve artificial brains would work in unison to provide a common answer, to be the impartial judge of humanity’s future actions. Such was the theory...but the Rule of the Brains threatened to destroy humanity itself!","20050101","Fearn, John Russell","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","2.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

They were phenomenally popular in the 1920s, and millions of copies were sold.
Fitzhugh was an American author. His first known work, The Goldenrod Story Book, was published in 1906. The bulk of his work, having a Boy Scouting theme, revolves around the fictional town of Bridgeboro, New Jersey. Characters included Tom Slade, Pee-wee Harris, Roy Blakely, and Westy Martin. Fitzhugh&#39;s Scouting based books were very popular with children and adults. His characters became so real to his readers that it was not uncommon for Percy to receive fan mail addressed to the characters themselves. 
In the 1930s, attempting to branch out, he began writing the Hal Keen Mystery Series (10 titles) under the pseudonym Hugh Lloyd. They were followed by another mystery series, Skippy Dare, though this one only lasted for 3 books. Neither of these series achieved the popularity of his Scout work.&lt;P>
This volume contains the first 7 Pee-Wee Harris books:&lt;P>

There have been outstandingly wicked vice lords, gamblers, robbers, and murderers. Hogan was all these and more. During his incredible life, he was a pirate, blockade runner, spy, bounty jumper, pimp, bartender, confidence man, and showman. He boasted of having sent over two hundred beautiful women to Hell to await his return. He was also the strongest man in the world, the uncrowned heavyweight bare-knuckle boxing champion, candidate for Congress, and finally, a fighting evangelist. At the climax of his life, he dominated one of the wildest and bawdiest periods of American history.

Ben Hogan really lived -- and perhaps he died. No one has evidence of his death. His end is as steeped in mystery as the incredible force that drove and sustained him throughout life.

To recreate Hogan's story, author Joseph J. Millard went to the oil-fields of Pennsylvania to walk the ground Ben Hogan walked, to see the scenes of his escapades. He dug into old newspapers and journals, into letters and diaries, and studied hundreds of old photographs of the era.

Lovecraft, M.R. James, Robert Bloch, Stanley Weinbaum, John W. Campbell, and Thomas M. Disch. In between we encounter such surprising topics as a proposal for an H.P. Lovecraft biopic (""The Whole Wide Lovecraft""), the eccentricities of William Beckford (the author of Vathek), and even a report from Blobfest, an annual street fair devoted to the famous 1958 cult film, at which Schweitzer, as a member of the press, was allowed to touch the original Blob. Many of these pieces have been published in the prestigious ""The New York Review of Science Fiction.""

Immediately upon arrival, her captain, one Willem van Groot, was met by two members of the local police and Professor Thomas Wilmerson of Miskatonic University, the latter having flown to Chile in response to an urgent radio message sent by van Groot four days before the Orient Princess reached port.<P>
Captain van Groot took with him from the ship, the log and a large notebook carefully wrapped in waterproof oilskin which he kept in his possession until the four men were seated around the table in Wilmerson’s hotel room and the door was securely locked. Only then did the captain place the two items on the table. Before speaking, he opened the ship’s log and riffled through the pages until he found the one he wanted.<P>
Glancing up, he looked at each man in turn, then said quietly, “Gentlemen, I can understand your curiosity concerning the radio message I dispatched but I can assure you that this matter is of the utmost importance and secrecy. I asked that you, Professor Wilmerson, should be here when we docked since this package”— he indicated the oilskin-wrapped book with his right hand—“is addressed to you personally and although I’ve only glanced through the contents, I shudder to think of what may have happened to the writer.”<P>

This was a battle of wills that could end in only one way, given the nature of the Tsar's personality and the enormous power that he wielded.

He held academic positions at both Oxford University (Magdalen College, 1925–1954) and Cambridge University (Magdalene College, 1954–1963). He is best known for his works of fiction, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain. Lewis and fellow novelist J. R. R. Tolkien were close friends. They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University, and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings. According to Lewis's memoir Surprised by Joy, he was baptised in the Church of Ireland, but fell away from his faith during adolescence. Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an “ordinary layman of the Church of England.” Lewis's faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.<P> Lewis wrote more than 30 books, which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularised on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations.<P> This volume collects C.S. Lewis’s classic “Space Trilogy,” consisting of Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra, and That Hideous Strength.<P> If you enjoy this ebook, don't forget to search your favorite ebook store for ""Wildside Press Megapack"" to see more of the 300+ volumes in this series, covering adventure, historical fiction, mysteries, westerns, ghost stories, science fiction -- and much, much more!","20190101","Lewis, C.S.","Author","","","","","AE AF AO AW AZ BB BD BH BI BJ BM BN BO BS BT BW BY BZ CA CD CF CG CM CN CO CU CV CY DJ DM DZ ET FM GA GD GM GN GQ GW HK HT ID IN IQ IR JM JO JP KG KH KI KM KN KP KR KW KZ LA LB LC LK LS LY MA MD MH ML MM MN MO MU MV MW MY NA NE NP NR OM RW SC SD SN SR SV SY SZ TD TG TH TJ TL TM TN TO TT TV TW TZ UG UZ VE VN ZA ZM ZW","","","","","","7.79","NOK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

During these first days of his life his home was in the heart of a great windfall where Gray Wolf, his blind mother, had found a safe nest for his babyhood, and to which Kazan, her mate, came only now and then, his eyes gleaming like strange balls of greenish fire in the darkness. It was Kazan’s eyes that gave to Baree his first impression of something existing away from his mother’s side, and they brought to him also his discovery of vision. He could feel, he could smell, he could hear—but in that black pit under the fallen timber he had never seen until the eyes came. At first they frightened him; then they puzzled him, and his fear changed to an immense curiosity. He would be looking straight at them, when all at once they would disappear. This was when Kazan turned his head. And then they would flash back at him again out of the darkness with such startling suddenness that Baree would involuntarily shrink closer to his mother, who always trembled and shivered in a strange sort of way when Kazan came in.<P>
Baree, of course, would never know their story. He would never know that Gray Wolf, his mother, was a full-blooded wolf, and that Kazan, his father, was a dog. In him nature was already beginning its wonderful work, but it would never go beyond certain limitations. It would tell him, in time, that his beautiful wolf-mother was blind, but he would never know of that terrible battle between Gray Wolf and the lynx in which his mother’s sight had been destroyed. Nature could tell him nothing of Kazan’s merciless vengeance, of the wonderful years of their matehood, of their loyalty, their strange adventures in the great Canadian wilderness—it could make him only a son of Kazan.<P>
But at first, and for many days, it was all mother. Even after his eyes had opened wide and he had found his legs so that he could stumble about a little in the darkness, nothing existed for Baree but his mother. When he was old enough to be playing with sticks and moss out in the sunlight, he still did not know what she looked like. But to him she was big and soft and warm, and she licked his face with her tongue, and talked to him in a gentle, whimpering way that at last made him find his own voice in a faint, squeaky yap.","20170101","Curwood, James Oliver","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","5.99","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Mauser himself was born a Mid-Lower. Ambitious, he had chosen one of the few professions, Category Military, where upward mobility was still a reasonable possibility.
<P>
To prevent any chance of a ruinous war between the West and the Sov-world, the Universal Disarmament Pact had restricted all militaries to pre-1900 technology. Gradually, powerful corporations began settling business disputes by hiring troops to fight real battles (fracases) on one of many military reservations. This served a dual purpose: to maintain a military well-honed by actual combat and to provide the decadent general population with a diversion. The life-and-death struggles are so popular that they are televised.
<P>
Mauser had worked his way up to captain and Middle-Middle status after many years of effort. When upstart Vacuum Tube Transport finds itself forced into an expensive, division-sized fracas with Continental Hovercraft, he sees his opportunity. He signs up with the underdog, even though the much wealthier Continental is able to hire the best soldiers available, including Marshal ""Stonewall"" Cogswell, the finest commander in the business. Mauser tells Baron Haer, the head of Vacuum Tube, that he can engineer an improbable victory with a gimmick he has been working on for a long time; in return, he expects the baron's support which, in conjunction with his anticipated popularity with fracas fans, should be enough to get him promoted into the Upper caste. The baron's son, Bart, scoffs at the undisclosed idea, but the baron is desperate for experienced officers and hires him.","19740101","Reynolds, Mack","Author","","","","","AE AF AL AM AN AO AQ AR AS AT AW AX AZ BA BB BE BF BG BH BI BJ BL BO BQ BR BV BY CA CC CD CF CG CH CI CK CL CM CN CO CR CS CU CV CW CX CZ DE DJ DK DO DZ EC EE EH ER ES ET FI FM FO FR GA GD GE GF GG GH GI GL GM GN GP GQ GR GS GT GU GW HM HN HR HT HU ID IM IR IS IT JE JP KG KH KI KM KP KR KZ LA LB LI LR LT LU LV LY MA MC MD ME MF MG MH MK ML MN MO MP MQ MR MS MV MX NC NE NF NI NL NO NU OM PA PE PF PH PL PM PR PS PT PW PY QA RE RO RS RU SE SI SJ SK SM SN SR SS ST SV SX SY TC TD TF TG TH TJ TK TL TM TN TO TW UA UM US UY UZ VA VE VI VN WF YT YU","","","","","","25.00","SEK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

In spite of his distaste for travel, Auguste Dupin makes the long southward journey, in the hope that he might be able to help an old friend, the evolutionist Claude Guérande. Guérande believes that he has made discoveries in the caves of Mont Dragon that might cast new light on the origin of humankind, and of life itself. Over the years, however, not everyone who has gone into the caves has come out again, and not everyone who has come out has been unaltered...and 1847 promises to be a critical year, more dangerous than any before it.

""Lincoln’s Shootin’ Fools"" -- The modern Pentagon wasn’t even a gleam in its parent’s eye when one of the world’s leading engineering firms figured out how simple it really was to win the Civil War. Then Commander-in-Chief, General Winfield Scott, issued his pronunciamento: “The muttle-loader is, has been, and always will be the American soldier’s prime weapon. Breech-loaders are not practical for military usage. They would spoil our troops by allowing them to fire too fast, thus wasting ammunition.”
What that stupid statement did to an angry man by the name of Hiram Berdan is history, but not quite the kind of history they print in textbooks for juniors....”
<P>
""Heller on Horseback"" -- The chances are very good that Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest never said anything as stupid as “the fustest with the mostest.” What he actually did was win battles against impossible odds...and how he managed to win those battles is a thing we don’t usually talk about in polite Southern society.
<P>
""The Devil’s Errand Boy"" -- Lafayette Baker had every opportunity to become the most popular General on the Union side of the war. Then he created the U.S. Secret Service as a tool of spite and blackmail, and turned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln into a pointless mystery that will probably never be solved.

The Red Bishop, by Howard Mason ... A wild chase through Europe...a castle on the Rhine...some very fancy corpses...a racing columnist who suddenly finds himself a Peer of the Realm...  These are the unlikely ingredients that make this book at once hair-raising and light-hearted!<BR>
Reclining Figure, by Marco Page ... Lucas Edgerton, arbitary and capricious eccentric, brings in Ellis Blaise, a young New York art dealer, to sell some of his art collection for tax purposes. Thefts from the collection, the sensational forgery of a priceless Renoir, and the puzzling murder of Lucas's son force Blaise into a perilous investigation!<BR>
The Case of the 16 Beans, by Harry Stephen Keeler ... Why did old Balhatchet Barkstone, on dying, leave his nephew 16 beans? And why did Boyce Barkstone, his heir, hold on to the beans? Why did Hu Fong, a Chinese detective, come to the conclusion that a poverty-stricken hermit was murdered for an article of great value, and what might that article be? These are only a few of the seemingly insoluble riddles which Keeler answers in his own inimitable manner!<BR>
The Girl Who Had to Die, by By Elisabeth Sanxay Holding ... 19-year-old Jocelyn is convinced she's going to be murdered, and accuses John Killian, a young man she met on a cruise ship, of throwing her overboard. But there are a lot of people who seem to hate Jocelyn...and Killian starts to wonder if he'll be the next victim instead!<P>

Writing in Vernacular Chinese as well as Classical Chinese, Lu Xun was a short story writer, editor, translator, literary critic, essayist, and poet. In the 1930s he became the titular head of the League of Left-Wing Writers in Shanghai.<P>
Lu Xun was born into a family of landlords and government officials in Shaoxing, Zhejiang; the family's financial resources declined over the course of his youth. Lu aspired to take the imperial civil service exam; but, due to his family's relative poverty, was forced to attend government-funded schools teaching ""Western education"". Upon graduation, Lu went to medical school in Japan, but later dropped out. He became interested in studying literature, but was eventually forced to return to China due to his family's lack of funds. After returning to China, Lu worked for several years teaching at local secondary schools and colleges before finally finding a job at the national Ministry of Education.<P>
After the 1919 May Fourth Movement, Lu Xun's writing began to exert a substantial influence on Chinese literature and popular culture. Like many leaders of the May Fourth Movement, he was primarily a leftist and liberal. He was highly acclaimed by the Chinese government after 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, and Mao Zedong himself was a lifelong admirer of Lu Xun's writing. Though sympathetic to socialist ideas, Lu Xun never joined the Communist Party of China.","20160101","Hsun, Lu","Author","Xun, Lu","Author","","","","","WORLD","","","","1.99","CAD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

It was hard to blame Howard Crane for bringing her aboard, because Julia always got what she wanted. What she wanted in this case was money. Keith Lambert’s—her ex-husband’s—money. That there were others too who wanted it was one of the first things that came to the minds of the Barbados police the next morning when Julia was found suffocated in her cabin. But the only trail they had to follow was one of tangled lives and tangled motives that led to jealousy, blackmail, native secrecy, and sudden death — all against the peaceful tropical background of picturesque Barbados.

Queen Marguerite and her sisters entertain themselves by luring unsuspecting men to the Tower, which located across the Seine from the Louvre. There they entice their victims to join them for wild sexual escapades--all expressly forbidden, of course, by both Church and State. Once satiated, the ladies have their lovers murdered, and the bodies dumped into the Seine. One man (Buridan) manages to escape, and uses his knowledge of what's taking place to force the Queen to make him Prime Minister. In the end of course, the secret cannot be maintained.

The story of his frantic odyssey in search of his former life could only have sprung from the anarchic imagination of Harry Stephen Keeler.<P>
NOTE: This book is not politically correct by current standards. It contains language and ideas relevant to the age in which it is set (1855) and was written in the 1930s, a less progressive time. It is dated, but remains a fascinating artifact of its era. Although it deals with race, it is decided anti-racism (which may be why it remained unpublished until discovered among Harry Stephen Keeler’s papers).<P>A note to the sensitive: the language is of its time period and it is not policitally correct by contemporary standards.","20090101","Keeler, Harry Stephen","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","75.00","MXN","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

Even after fifty years and several hundred centuries, he remembered it as vividly as though it had happened an hour before.

It was a warm, fresh day with a promise of spring--the first really pleasant day of the year after the usual vagaries of a midwest winter. He strolled leisurely through the park, thinking with shameless delight of the stuffy classrooms he was avoiding. Eventually he seated himself on a patch of greening grass with a convenient tree to lean against and enjoyed the soft breeze and the peaceful surroundings while he absently whittled on a twig he had picked up. He felt sleepy. Probably he dozed off. 
<P>
Then came a tremendous jerk, like having a chair pulled from under him at the same instant that a truck hit him, and he almost lost consciousness. He landed with a painful bump and skidded for a short distance along a very rough wood floor. For a moment he sat gazing about him dazedly. He had been abruptly translated from his seat on the ground in a pleasant park on a lovely spring day to a seat on a wood floor in a large, dim room with a thunderstorm raging outside. He had a distinct impression that the two scenes had been linked by an earthquake. He tried hard to focus his thoughts, staring first at a table where a candle burned brightly and then at an animal tied to one of the table's legs by a short leash. It was a hairy pig.

Then Alan Grant steps into the tawdry sideshow where Aerita is being held to kill an idle hour—and found himself plunged head-over-heels into a maelstrom of battling adventure that took him across a hundred million miles of space, involved him in a vast civil war on an alien planet, and shouldered him with the fearsome responsibility for the safety of Earth!","20200101","Cummings, Ray","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

<P>
PRAISE FOR BOOK 1: ""It’s been nearly a century since Edgar Rice Burroughs first enchanted readers with his tales of John Carter and Dejah Thoris on the planet Barsoom. Since then, generations of writers have tried to recapture Burroughs' magic: from Otis Adelbert Kline and Robert E. Howard to Leigh Brackett, Lin Carter, Andre Norton and a hundred more. Gary Lovisi adds his name to the list with The Winged Men, a marvelous romp that updates ERB’s Confederate vet to Jon Kirk, an American apparently killed in Vietnam only to find himself miraculously transported to the planet Ares. Jon Kirk's adventures among beautiful women, barbarous men and cannibalistic aliens demonstrates all the heart of a true lover of the interplanetary romance, and will surely delight readers with a yearning to escape the stress of modern civilization and travel to a world of action, intrigue, gallantry and romance."" -- Richard A. Lupoff, Author of ""Barsoom: Edgar Rice Burroughs and the Martian Vision""
<P>
""I very much enjoyed this book. In my view, as intended, it has Burroughs’ vividness, look, sound, sentiment, honesty, directness, sweep, vigor, and appeal, but there is Lovisi in there, too. It is a fresh country in its own right, and certainly one that ERB, and those fond of ERB, like myself, would recognize, find familiar, welcome and relish. I bet ERB would have liked it, too."" -- John Norman, creator of Tarl Cabot and the famous Gor books series.","20150101","Lovisi, Gary","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","7.50","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Primrose Mystery Novel” might have well been called ""The New Mrs. Latham Mystery Novel,"" because Mrs. Latham plays almost as important a part in it as the Colonel. The scene is Hawaii, and practically all of the action takes place in and around a house high up on the mountainside above Honolulu. It is the story of a black-sheep American, whose family had lived in Hawaii for generations, but who went to Japan and, sometime after Pearl Harbor, decided to come back and play traitor to his country.
<P>
Mrs. Latham is present when he makes his first appearance in his family’s house, she is present when his murdered body is discovered -- and disposed of -- and she is deeply involved in the circumstances that lead up to the second murder, that of a beautiful Hawaiian- American girl who is engaged to marry an American aviator. In fact, Mrs. Latham this time is so much involved that Colonel Primrose accuses her of completely spoiling an air-tight case for him and calls her a nitwit. Shortly after that, for the first time in these stories, he proposes to Mrs. Latham. For the answer, reader, you may write your own ticket!
<P>
""HONOLULU STORY will be enthusiastically revived by mystery fans who have learned to expect good entertainment from Leslie Ford's novels. In this book the usual excellent performance is turned in by that fictional threesome, Colonel Primrose, special agent in military intelligence, his aide, the intrepid Sgt. Phineas Buck, and likable Grace Latham, socially prominent Washington widow."" -- The Nebraska State Journal

It is more a laugh-aloud series of encounters than a deadly feud, and you will enjoy the blow by hilarious blow description of each encounter. In his pursuit of the bob-nosed alligator, Dad Peps is assisted by his son, Hughie (if you are of a mind to regard as ""assistant"" the partner who performs 96 percent of the labor.) In eight farcical encounters between Shovel Nose and the Pepses, other beasts, and other Homo sapiens are sometimes enmeshed, but in the final encounter it is Shovel Nose versus the Pepses deep in the primordial swamp.<P>

In his fanatic determination to capture Shovel Nose, Dad Peps’ ingenuity always exceeds his practicality, and the result invariably makes life no worse than unsettling for Shovel Nose, unsatisfying tor Dad Peps, and provides hilarity for the reader. A classic children's book, parts of which were serialized in Boy's Life magazine.","19630101","Alter, Robert Edmond","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","3.99","CAD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

These tales show the way in which the Gothic form has been transposed to a new, alien environment--Australia! The outback, the desert, the bush are imbued with strange forces and beings that European explorers and fossickers must fathom and overcome. The colonists struggle to cope with the harsh landscape and climate, and are frequently claimed by it. The land itself seems almost a malignant force that exacts a terrible revenge on those who challenge it or wander thoughtlessly into its desert wastes. Thus, in many of the stories reprinted here, characters range across a landscape in which the supernatural can reach out and snatch the unwary at any time. Characters frequently fall victim to the bush; indeed, often it is the children, symbols of innocence and European naïveté, who fall victim to the evil ""spirits"" lurking just beyond human ken. Doig has resurrected these marvelous haunts from rare magazines and equally scarce collections, and has provided hard-to-find information about the authors and the times in which they lived.

It's based on the suspicion that King Alexander the Great was poisoned, and left an infant daughter, Olympias, by his Persian wife Statira, daughter of the last Persian king. Olympias was raised by Cassander, son of King Antipater of Macedon, who's also tried to murder Statira (although she survived, unbeknownst to him). Now Cassader has succeeded his father as King, but is riddled with guilt over his crimes. Olympias has been raised in ignorance by Cassander, whom she loves. When the real facts of her origin--and her proposed husband's evil deeds--are revealed to her by her mother, she's caught between her genuine affection for the King, and the knowledge of who he really is. Included with this classic play is THE TEMPLE OF GLORY, an opera libretto set in classical times. Two little-known works by one of the greatest French writers.","20130101","Morlock, Frank J.","Translated by","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","4.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

He immediately finds himself regarded as a hero and at the same time a spy-suspect, both situations arising from a series of incidents involving the young Major George Washington.<P>
Matt and Chief, his elderly Indian accomplice, begin their adventure by foiling an ambush of Washington. Shortly afterward, Matt is part of the young Washington’s first military command. The colonial militia, augmented by British regulars, sets out to intercept a French and Indian invasion.<P>
Washington is beset by the resentment of regular British officers at being subordinate to a colonist. He is also hampered by the lack of discipline in his militia, and by the nagging doubt about whether one of the colonials in his command is practicing treachery. The climax comes when the young colonel, abandoned by the British and outnumbered by the enemy, decides to erect a primitive defense which history remembers as Fort Necessity.<P>

She was the subject of the 1973 BBC miniseries A Picture of Katherine Mansfield starring Vanessa Redgrave. The six-part series included adaptations of Mansfield's life and of her short stories. In 2011, a biopic film titled ""Bliss"" was made of her early beginnings as a writer in New Zealand.<P>

Their home, like all the others in town, is boarded up at night; the entire community is living in fear of four ghostly horsemen, who ride only at night. Refusing to share the terrified townsfolk's fear of the supernatural, Terry trails the mystery riders, but they seem to vanish into thin air in Star Canyon.

Here the Amazon encounters Mizanu, the embodiment of evil, and her most deadly foe yet--for the creature is nothing less than a planet-sized, hypertrophied brain! Not even Abna, the master of metaphysics, can withstand its baleful, crushing mental power. Mizanu threatens to reach out beyond the Alpha-Proxima Centauri system to engulf the Earth and all the other inhabited planets of the universe--unless the Golden Amazon can destroy it first! The eighth exciting adventure in this ongoing saga!","19530101","Fearn, John Russell","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","2.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

In ""The Quills of Henry Thomas,"" W. C. and Aja Bamberger give us a glimpse of a future in which music is composed through DNA computing. ""The Gizzard Wizard"" is Rory Barnes's delightful sequel to his young adult SF novel, Space Junk. John Gregory Betancourt's engaging ""The Darkfishers"" envisions a shanghaied Earth colony stranded on the back of a huge crustacean on an ocean planet. Sydney J. Bounds, in ""Guinea Pigs,"" portrays a future dominated by cutthroat corporations.

""Outside Looking In,"" by Mark E. Burgess, takes the ""world in a bottle"" theme--and turns it upside down. Victor Cilinca's ""Siegfried"" demonstrates the folly of taking those ""primitive"" aliens too lightly. Michael R. Collings's ""The Calling of Iam'Kendron"" is a stirring prequel to his epic science-fantasy novel, Wordsmith. In Arthur Jean Cox's ""Evergreen,"" we find that long life is not always what it's cracked up to be.

Award-winning author Jack Dann depicts, in ""Mohammed’s Angel,"" an all-too-plausible future in which cultures, sensibilities, and terrorist acts are inextricably mixed. ""Ultra Evolution,"" by John Russell Fearn, is a cautionary tale about the advancement of man—not always a good thing! Sheila Finch's ""Miles to Go"" is the moving story of a wheelchair marathoner faced with a crucial decision. Mel Gilden relates mankind's first encounter with aliens in ""The Little Finger of the Left Hand.""

But the gold he carried from the valley was to bring terrible ordeals to Rusty and to the tribe. In an attempt to steal a bag of the nuggets, the ruthless frontiersman Charlie Galway murdered a white friend of Rusty’s and escaped unseen. The angry townspeople accused Standing Bull, a Cheyenne war chief, of the crime. When Rusty’s pleas for a fair trial were disregarded, he rescued the young chief from a lynch mob, taking him back to their tribe.&lt;P>

After an unstated amount of time later, their son John Clayton II is born.[2] At the age of one, his mother dies and soon thereafter his father is killed by the savage king ape, Kerchak. The infant Clayton, subsequently adopted by the she-ape Kala, is named Tarzan ('White Skin' in the ape language) and is raised in ignorance of his human heritage.<P>
As a boy, feeling alienated from his peers due to their physical differences, Tarzan discovers his true parents' cabin, where he first learns of others like himself in their books. Using basic primers with pictures, over many years he teaches himself to read English, but having never heard it, cannot speak it.<P>
Upon his return from one visit to the cabin, he is attacked by a huge gorilla whom he manages to kill with his father's knife, although he is terribly wounded in the struggle. As he grows up, Tarzan becomes a skilled hunter, exciting the jealousy of Kerchak, the ape leader, who finally attacks him. Tarzan kills Kerchak and takes his place as ""king"" of the apes.<P>
Later, a tribe of black Africans settle in the area, and Tarzan's adopted mother, Kala, is killed by one of their hunters. Avenging himself on the killer, Tarzan begins an antagonistic relationship with the tribe, raiding its village for weapons and practicing cruel pranks on them. They, in turn, regard him as an evil spirit and attempt to placate him.<P>
A few years later, when Tarzan is 18 years of age, a new party is marooned on the coast, including 19 year old Jane Porter, the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen. Tarzan's cousin, William Cecil Clayton, unwitting usurper of the ape man's ancestral English estate, is also among the party.","20200101","Burroughs, Edgar Rice","Author","Wurf, Karl","Introduction by","","","","","WORLD","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

He had been raised by the Greek, Apollodorus, upon the Mediterranean island of Sicily after his father Quintus Salvidienus Rufus had been executed by Mark Antony as a traitor, even though his father had secretly been working for the young Roman prince, Octavian.<P>
Octavian, who was the nephew, adopted son—and heir to the Great Julius Caesar.<P>
Caesar had been assassinated and soon afterwards had become a god—and young Octavian at just eighteen years of age had become the son of a god among the Romans—and eventually became the sole ruler of Rome.<P>
He quickly took the name Octavian Caesar. Years later he would transform himself yet again and take the name Augustus—meaning revered, auspicious, augmenting. All honor due to him. The young heir to Julius Caesar seemed to many a bit full of himself in those early days, some like Mark Antony often derided him his youth and arrogance—but few realized the greatness hidden within that youth—until it was too late. Octavian was a young man who had been given many honors and titles, and he would hold the office of Consul of Rome a total of thirteen times throughout his life, more than any other man in the history of Rome. He would be hailed Imperator—victorious general; and Princeps—First Citizen—all important honors and titles he held among many others that he had contrived the Senate to bestow upon him. But honorable titles and grand names were not the true power held by the man. His control over the Roman legions was where his true power lay. And for Octavian—Augustus—that control was absolute. The legions were loyal to him—to a man!<P>","20170101","Lovisi, Gary","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","3.99","CAD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Is it any wonder that authors sometimes had to stretch to find subjects that hadn’t already been covered? Titles like ""Scandalous Nurse."" ""Future Nurse"" (no, it’s not science fiction -- but it might have been!) ""Nurse in the Tropics."" ""Resort Nurse."" ""Ozark Nurse."" ""Everglades Nurse."" ""Night Club Nurse.""

Between 1889 and 1922, he published nearly 300 mystery stories (many in series that were collected as books, such as this one.)<P>
Many of Muddock’s mystery stories feature the character Dick Donovan, a Glasgow Detective, named for one of the 18th Century Bow Street Runners. The character was so popular that later stories were published under this pen name. Muddock also wrote true crime stories, horror, and 37 novels, most as “Dick Donovan.” His non-fiction included four history books, seven guidebooks for areas in the Alps and his autobiography.

<P>
PRAISE FOR BOOK 1: ""It’s been nearly a century since Edgar Rice Burroughs first enchanted readers with his tales of John Carter and Dejah Thoris on the planet Barsoom. Since then, generations of writers have tried to recapture Burroughs' magic: from Otis Adelbert Kline and Robert E. Howard to Leigh Brackett, Lin Carter, Andre Norton and a hundred more. Gary Lovisi adds his name to the list with The Winged Men, a marvelous romp that updates ERB’s Confederate vet to Jon Kirk, an American apparently killed in Vietnam only to find himself miraculously transported to the planet Ares. Jon Kirk's adventures among beautiful women, barbarous men and cannibalistic aliens demonstrates all the heart of a true lover of the interplanetary romance, and will surely delight readers with a yearning to escape the stress of modern civilization and travel to a world of action, intrigue, gallantry and romance."" -- Richard A. Lupoff, Author of ""Barsoom: Edgar Rice Burroughs and the Martian Vision""
<P>
""I very much enjoyed this book. In my view, as intended, it has Burroughs’ vividness, look, sound, sentiment, honesty, directness, sweep, vigor, and appeal, but there is Lovisi in there, too. It is a fresh country in its own right, and certainly one that ERB, and those fond of ERB, like myself, would recognize, find familiar, welcome and relish. I bet ERB would have liked it, too."" -- John Norman, creator of Tarl Cabot and the famous Gor books series.","20150101","Lovisi, Gary","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","7.50","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Life on Earth becomes intolerable, until he volunteers to travel on the world first interstellar spaceship--a multi-generation colony ship that will take centuries to complete its voyage.

It postulates an island in the ancient Greek world where the slaves have revolted and seized power, killing all of their former masters and declaring their independence. Now, any ""masters"" shipwrecked on their island are forced to live as slaves of their own slaves to impress upon them the wrongs they've committed. THE MERCHANT OF SMYRNA, by Nicolas Chamfort, and THE BEAUTIFUL SLAVE, by Antoine-Jean Dumaniant, both deal with the pain that Christian and Muslim lovers experience when one (or both) of them are captured and sold into slavery--and then are fortuitously freed by their new owners or through their own efforts. These dramas represent early moral judgments in the late eighteenth century on the evils of slavery, and as such, are important milestones in the history of European drama.","20130101","Morlock, Frank J.","Edited by","de Marivaux, Pierrie","Author","","","","","WORLD","","","","3.99","USD","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

This adaptation of the Zola novel of the same name is a powerful exposé of life among the working poor, and the ravaging effects of alcholism on average, decent folk. If fact, what's most striking in this play is how human the workers are, certainly not the ""animals"" described by opponents of Zola's works.

The cask is from a consignment of French wine, but it is bigger than the rest, its sides reinforced to hold the extraordinary weight within. Unfortunately, the longshoremen bringing it onto the London docksaccidentally break it open, spilling out a treasure of gold sovereigns.<P>
As workers cram the spilled gold into their pockets, an official digs through the opened cask, which is supposed to contain a statue. Beneath the gold he finds a woman’s hand—as cold as marble, but made of flesh. He reports the body to his superiors, but when he returns, the cask has vanished.<P>
The case is assigned to Inspector Burnley, a methodical Scotland Yard detective, who will confront a baffling array of clues and red herrings, alibis and outright lies, as he attempts to identify the woman in the cask—and catch the killer.","20180101","Crofts, Freeman Wills","Author","","","","","AE AF AO AW AZ BB BD BH BI BJ BM BN BO BS BT BW BY BZ CA CD CF CG CM CN CO CU CV CY DJ DM DZ ET FM GA GD GM GN GQ GW HK HT ID IN IQ IR JM JO JP KG KH KI KM KN KP KR KW KZ LA LB LC LK LS LY MA MD MH ML MM MN MO MU MV MW MY NA NE NP NR OM RW SC SD SN SR SV SY SZ TD TG TH TJ TL TM TN TO TT TV TW TZ UG US UZ VE VN ZA ZM ZW","","","","","","7.79","NOK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

Bill Mason, BSI, collects and annotates these parody names, from the first one that appeared in 1891, to the present day. As Mason says in his introduction:<P>
One of the great aspects of Sherlock Holmes is the fact that, just as the character himself is subject to endless variation, so is his name. Ellery Queen noted that the name itself “is particularly susceptible to the twistings and mis-shapenings of burlesque minded authors.” Surely, Arthur Conan Doyle, who struggled a little with what he was going to call his detective hero, could not have known just how perfect the name he finally selected—Sherlock Holmes—would be for parody, for rhyme, for the transposing of letters and sounds, for the substitution of suggestive words in the name of a comic character.<P>
Mason’s listings are an invaluable resource for the Holmsian scholar, researcher, or for those interested in whiling away a few hours with a delightful and chuckle-inspiring volume.","20190101","Mason, Bill","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","75.00","MXN","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

To make matters worse, her son Friedrich is associating with an American who talks endlessly of wellness and yoghurt, while her bodyguard is pestering her to return home to Georgia, half a world away. It seems that everyone--friends, enemies, and “Saucy Jack” alike--have conspired to interrupt her work.
<P>
But Varanus did not obtain immortality just to have mad killers and distant relations get in the way of scientific progress. Though supernatural conspiracies and all-too-human monsters confront her at every turn, Varanus will stand firm against all odds.

These tales were billed “Tommy and Tuppence—A Detective Series by Agatha Christie” and would later be collected as Partners in Crime. “The Adventure of the Sinister Stranger,” would become the sixth story in the collection.
<P>The conceit of the series is simple: The Beresfords’ friend Mr Carter, who works for a government intelligence agency, arrives bearing a proposition for the adventurous duo. They are to take over The International Detective Agency, a recently cleaned-out spy stronghold, and pose as the owners so as to intercept any enemy messages coming through. In the meantime Tommy and Tuppence can take on cases as this detective agency, an opportunity that delights the young couple. They employ Albert, a young man introduced in The Secret Adversary, as their assistant at the agency.
<P>The two tackle a series of cases, each mimicking the style of a famous fictional detective of the period, including Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Thorndyke, G.K. Chesterton, A.E.W. Mason, and even Christie’s own Hercule Poirot (among others). “The Adventure of the Sinister Stranger” is an espionage story, following in the footsteps of Valentine Williams and the detective brothers Francis and Desmond Okewood. One of Williams’ books in particular—The Man with the Clubfoot (1918)—is mentioned by Tuppence in the story.","20200101","Christie, Agatha","Author","","","","","US","","","","","","2.99","BRL","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

The main character, Tommy Twotoes, was (aside from his 300-pound avoir-dupois) based upon my great good friend, the late “Sunny Jim” Coffroth. Coffroth was without question the greatest sports pro­moter of all time, and I’m not forgetting Rickard or any of the others. He was also one of the zaniest and most completely lov­able human beings I have ever known. Twotoes was criticized in some quarters as being on the fantastic side. The answer to that is that I had to tone the real Coffroth down when I depicted him as the fictional Twotoes, for I knew no editor of fiction would accept the true-life article as being remotely possible. As for Rooke, Tommy was crippled from alcoholic neuritis and needed a pair of legs. I invented the Soldier to supply my hefty hero with a means of locomotion. Rooke, I think, derived mainly out of the nowhere into the here. He was depicted in my early novels as being a veteran of the iron coffins (tanks) in War Number Two and as liking his likker. In those two small respects, at least, he resembled his creator.","19530101","Alexander, David","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","7.79","NOK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

He was also a pioneer of early fandom, a founder of the Philadelphia Science Fiction Society, a fanzine publisher, and a World Science Fiction Convention chairman. After World War II, he became one of the country's leading nuclear physicists, but continued to write science fiction throughout his life. Here, for the first time, all his science fiction stories are collected in one volume, giving a clear picture of the author's development from youth to old age, reflecting lifelong preoccupations with physics, mathematics, music, the futility of war, and, of course, science fiction itself.<P>
Here is an authentic voice from the early years of the modern science fiction field. Features an introduction by science fiction master Frederik Pohl, and afterwords by son Tony Rothman as well as fan and fellow author Robert A. Madle. Edited by Darrell Schweitzer and Lee Weinstein.

Williamson, and a number of other books. When the original Masques appeared, I remember looking at the spine and noting that it was published a company called Maclay that I had never heard of before. But that name stuck, and soon I began noting John Maclay's stories in various anthologies and magazines. He -- like many of the dark fantasists who emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s -- had a distinctive voice, very different from the fantasists who came before. He still writes that way, fusing horror, fantasy, and suspense (often with an erotic element).<P>
""Over the years, John has steadily built up an impressing body of work, and I am delighted that he accepted my invitation to contribute a volume to the MEGAPACK® series. So here are 15 modern classics of dark fiction. Enjoy!""<P>

Even so, the story was greeted with outrage by British reviewers, some of whom suggested that Wilde should be prosecuted on moral grounds, leading Wilde to defend the novel aggressively in letters to the British press. Wilde later revised the story for book publication, making substantial alterations, deleting controversial passages, adding new chapters and including an aphoristic Preface which has since become famous in its own right. The amended version was published by Ward, Lock and Company in April 1891. Some scholars believe that Wilde would today have wanted us to read the version he originally submitted to Lippincott's.

(Where else are you going to find stories like ""Blood for the Vampire Dead,"" ""Mistress of Snarling Death,"" or ""When Super-Apes Plot""?) Of course, these stories were all written in a different time, with different standards of what was acceptable. They are decidedly NOT politically correct by modern standards. Please go into them aware of this fact, and if you are offended by racism, stereotypes, bad writing, sadism, or anything else prevalent in cheap literature of the early 20th century...well, this may not be the right ebook for you. But if you can sit back and enjoy these stories for what they are—simple titlations from another era—you may find some surprising treats.

<P>
Ketya, neglected daughter of Ananya’s most powerful official, wakes in the arms of the dead Empress. Along with her father she is rescued by Sperrin, a famous soldier whose post-traumatic stress disorder was “treated” by removing memories of his wife and daughter—memories which have returned with the destruction of Ananya’s magic. Ketya finds herself fleeing into the uncertain safety of the mountains where she and Sperrin hope to regroup with other survivors. Ketya’s father holds the answers to what happened and whether Ananya’s magic can be restored—but the disaster that happened on his watch has shattered his sanity, leaving his daughter and her rescuer to try and piece things together.
<P>
Harried by creatures out of ancient history Ketya and Sperrin make their way toward a mountain stronghold where an Ananyan army still stands, besieged by fey who want to retake the mountains they lost in the Holy Wars. Amid a desperate battle they uncover the depths of betrayal that ravaged Ananya—a betrayal that can only be undone if they agree to escort the traitor to the land of the gods themselves.","20180101","Grossman, Leigh","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","75.00","MXN","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EPUB"

The current heir, Canny Kilcannon, is anxious to dispose of this burden, but is unsure as to how far he can go in tempting fate. When his father dies, his life is further complicated when a female beneficiary of a similar centuries-old lucky streak reveals herself to him. Lissa suggests that they attempt the ultimate experiment—to test the boundaries of their gift. Can they succeed? Or will they bring down upon them the “black lightning” of which both of their traditions warn?

A truly compelling tale of luck and probability in the real world.

THE KING OF ROME focuses on the Emperor Napoleon's only son, the Duke of Reichstadt, who was held a captive by his maternal grandfather, the Emperor of Austria. Fearing that he would emulate his father or be used by a Napoleonic conspiracy to capture the French throne, the Duke was kept in ignorance of his father's identity, as well as of the basic facts of recent European history; and an attempt was also made to debauch his morals, in order to discredit his name if he did escape. This play traces the attempt of a French soldier to penetrate the Austrian palace where the boy was kept, as part of a failed attempt to free him from his ""prison""; and the awakening of the younger Napoleon to an awareness of his deadly family heritage.

Yet undoubtedly today’s officers are engaged in a wider variety of experiences than ever before in our history.<P>
This series of Occasional Papers produced by the Center for International Systems Research was designed to provide a forum for the expression of significant ideas by foreign affairs professionals, whereby they may go beyond the language of everyday reporting, may speculate or conjecture in the field of their specialization. In particular, these papers will provide an opportunity to assess the impact of contemporary systems research upon the operations of the foreign affairs community. This series offers an opportunity to communicate new ideas and evaluate old. At the same time, students of foreign relations, and others, have the opportunity to listen in, as it were, to a record which is neither an official report nor a formal journal, but a highly individualistic, personal narrative.<P>
Because these Occasional Papers are indeed personal by nature, and are so meant to be, they do not represent the official position of the Department of State. They are considered reactions of highly skilled professionals to professional problems, situations, events that are of concern to them.<P>
At the time of publication, CHRIS ARGYRIS was professor of organizational behavior and chairman of the Department of Administrative Sciences at Yale University.

Since Ishta was too young to bring her discovery to the Baron of Varag’s stronghold, her older brother, Garander, went instead. Once there, Azlia, a beautiful wizard, recognized the stone immediately as Northern sorcery. She had to call Sammel, the local sorcerer, to find out its nature . . . a relic of the last great war.

Their off-and-on ""war"" between the sexes is both convincing and riotously funny, particularly when both characters begin getting on each other's nerves.

In the early 1880s he went to Texas, where he stayed for 10 years, spending much of that time driving cattle on the western trail. He began writing at the age of 43, publishing his most successful book, The Log of a Cowboy, in 1903. The Log of a Cowboy is an account of a five-month drive of 3,000 cattle from Brownsville, Texas, to Montana in 1882 along the Great Western Cattle Trail. Although the book is fiction, it is firmly based on Adams’s own experiences on the trail, and it is considered by many to be the best account of cowboy life in literature.

Indeed, he was working on a dramatization of The Queen's Necklace at the time of his death in 1870. This was never published, but French playwright Pierre Decourcelle then produced his own version of this work. A successful dramatist, Decourcelle did a brilliant job of adapting Dumas's epic novel, salting the text with such larger-than-life figures as King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoninette, Cagliostro, and the Countess de la Motte. When the scandal surrounding the French court finally breaks, you have the feeling that you're actually there, watching the tragedy unfold before your eyes.

Barnum's rivals); ""The Not-So-Great Trans-Atlantic Circus and Menagerie"" (how a show failed suddenly in a yellow fever epidemic); ""What Goes Up...Comes Down"" (how balloning became part of the circus environment); and ""The Chicken or the Egg?"" (on the first development of the double-ring act pioneered by Barnum and others). These vivid essays, highlighted by numerous contemporaneous excerpts from local newspapers, help bring a long-forgotten era alive again.","20160101","Slout, William L.","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","29.99","NOK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

That was Rawe North’s thanks to Tripp Devero, who'd saved him from a knife in the back. Being ranchers, they sided each other against the riffraff of the city. Yet back on the range it was a fight to the death. The country was big, but not big enough for both of them.

So when Rawe returned to find his cattle rustled, his men dead or deserted, his range burned, he vowed to settle accounts with Tripp Devero in gunfire. But first he had an empire to win back. There was one way for Rawe to get cattle fast -- to steal them; one way for him to keep them -- to murder for them.

But like real people everywhere, few of these Souls have any inkling of what they did to deserve their fates--or what to do to make things better. The greatest among them can only guess--and pay the price for their actions. Here is the price that Del Rimon Farris pays to convey his vision to his future descendants.

She and the others in her class were supposed to write about something exciting that had happened over the weekend. All of her friends had either found an adventure or caused one to happen, but Prue had thought of nothing. Suddenly she remembered the one exciting event in her town -- an unknown young man had been mysteriously shot eight years earlier. Although he was never identified, every year, on the anniversary of his death, someone placed red carnations on his grave. Neither the mystery of the shooting nor that of the flowers had ever been solved. Perhaps Prue could make an adventure out of visiting the grave.<P>
She slipped out into the waning daylight, and hurried over to the cemetery. As she started toward the wooden grave-marker, Prue realized that someone else -- a man -- was already there. He turned and strode away. Prue tiptoed closer. A bouquet of red carnations was lying on the dead stranger's grave!<P>
This was the beginning of real adventure for Prue, her brother, and two friends, one that lasted much longer than a weekend.<P>
As in all Mary C. Jane's mysteries, the excitement and pace of her story build up to a satisfying climax. While her characters are confronted with a hidden gun, a strange woman prowling around an empty house, and a suspicious neighbor, these details fit plausibly into the everyday world of a small New England town.","19680101","Jane, Mary C.","Author","","","","","","","WORLD","","","","15.99","DKK","Library","01","RRP excluding tax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WORLD","","EPUB"

Largely set in a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by only a single individual: the story's protagonist. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in essay form, Brave New World Revisited (1958), and with his final novel, Island (1962), the utopian counterpart. The novel is often compared to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (published 1949).<P>
In 1999, the Modern Library ranked Brave New World at number 5 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, Robert McCrum, writing for The Observer, included Brave New World chronologically at number 53 in ""the top 100 greatest novels of all time"", and the novel was listed at number 87 on The Big Read survey by the BBC.<P>
