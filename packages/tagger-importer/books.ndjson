From Francisco Ferrer&rsquo;s modern schools in Spain and the Work People&rsquo;s College in the United States, to contemporary actions in developing &ldquo;free skools&rdquo; in the U.K. and Canada, to direct-action education such as learning to work as a &ldquo;street medic&rdquo; in the protests against neoliberalism, the contributors illustrate the importance of developing complex connections between educational theories and collective actions. Anarchists, activists, and critical educators should take these educational experiences seriously as they offer invaluable examples for potential teaching and learning environments outside of authoritarian and capitalist structures. Major themes in the volume include: learning from historical anarchist experiments in education, ways that contemporary anarchists create dynamic and situated learning spaces, and finally, critically reflecting on theoretical frameworks and educational practices.

Of course, if anarchists agree that there are no blueprints for education, the question remains, in what dynamic and creative ways can we construct nonhierarchical, anti-authoritarian, mutual, and voluntary educational spaces?\nContributors to this edited volume engage readers in important and challenging issues in the area of anarchism and education. From Francisco Ferrer&rsquo;s modern schools in Spain and the Work People&rsquo;s College in the United States, to contemporary actions in developing &ldquo;free skools&rdquo; in the U.K. and Canada, to direct-action education such as learning to work as a &ldquo;street medic&rdquo; in the protests against neoliberalism, the contributors illustrate the importance of developing complex connections between educational theories and collective actions. Anarchists, activists, and critical educators should take these educational experiences seriously as they offer invaluable examples for potential teaching and learning environments outside of authoritarian and capitalist structures. Major themes in the volume include: learning from historical anarchist experiments in education, ways that contemporary anarchists create dynamic and situated learning spaces, and finally, critically reflecting on theoretical frameworks and educational practices. Contributors include: David Gabbard, Jeffery Shantz, Isabelle Fremeaux &amp; John Jordan, Abraham P. DeLeon, Elsa Noterman, Andre Pusey, Matthew Weinstein, Alex Khasnabish, and many others."}{"isbnPrint":"9781604862218","isbn":"9781604866674","_id":"pmpressimport_Anarchist_Seeds_beneath_the_Snow","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"Anarchist_Seeds_beneath_the_Snow_9781604866674.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/Anarchist_Seeds_beneath_the_Snow_9781604866674.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/Anarchist_Seeds_beneath_the_Snow_.jpg"},"title":"Anarchist Seeds beneath the Snow: Left-Libertarian Thought and British Writers from William Morris to Colin Ward","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Anarchist Seeds beneath the Snow","slug":"anarchist-seeds-beneath-the-snow","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"Left-Libertarian Thought and British Writers from William Morris to Colin Ward","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"David  Goodway","Contributor 2 Role":"","Contributor 2 Full Name":"","Contributor 3 Role":"","Contributor 3 Full Name":"","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"24.95","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>From William Morris to Oscar Wilde to George Orwell, left-libertarian thought has long been an important but neglected part of British cultural and political history.

Through a critique of Samuel Huntington&rsquo;s notion of a &ldquo;Third Wave&rdquo; of democratization, the author relates Asian uprisings to predecessors in 1968 and shows their subsequent influence on uprisings in Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s. By empirically reconstructing the specific history of each Asian uprising, significant insight into major constituencies of change and the trajectories of these societies becomes visible.\nThis book provides detailed histories of uprisings in nine places&mdash;the Philippines, Burma, Tibet, China, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, and Indonesia&mdash;as well as introductory and concluding chapters that place them in a global context and analyze them in light of major sociological theories. Profusely illustrated with photographs, tables, graphs, and charts, it is the definitive, and defining, work from the eminent participant-observer scholar of social movements."}

But it offers neither dire predictions nor false hopes. Instead, it embraces the mystery of what might transpire. The word &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; has not always signified &ldquo;disaster&rdquo;; during the sixteenth century, especially in theater, it came to mean &ldquo;a reversal of what is expected.&rdquo; <em>Black Box</em> is ultimately a documentary project, a record of the catastrophe, but it&rsquo;s an open question where the inquiry will take us. It may be a record of the disastrous end.

But it offers neither dire predictions nor false hopes. Instead, it embraces the mystery of what might transpire. The word &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; has not always signified &ldquo;disaster&rdquo;; during the sixteenth century, especially in theater, it came to mean &ldquo;a reversal of what is expected.&rdquo; Black Box is ultimately a documentary project, a record of the catastrophe, but it&rsquo;s an open question where the inquiry will take us. It may be a record of the disastrous end. Or it may be a record of the turning.\nThe first volume contains an eclectic but accessible collection of reportage, interviews, letters, fragments, and theoretical responses from some of the brightest minds in critical theory.

Brian Willson and the theme that runs throughout his compelling psycho-historical memoir. Willson&rsquo;s story begins in small-town, rural America, where he grew up as a &ldquo;Commie-hating, baseball-loving Baptist,&rdquo; moves through life-changing experiences in Viet Nam, Nicaragua and elsewhere, and culminates with his commitment to a localized, sustainable lifestyle.</p> <p>In telling his story, Willson provides numerous examples of the types of personal, risk-taking, nonviolent actions he and others have taken in attempts to educate and effect political change: tax refusal&mdash;which requires simplification of one&rsquo;s lifestyle; fasting&mdash;done publicly in strategic political and/or therapeutic spiritual contexts; and obstruction tactics&mdash;strategically placing one&rsquo;s body in the way of &ldquo;business as usual.&rdquo; It was such actions that thrust Brian Willson into the public eye in the mid-&rsquo;80s, first as a participant in a high-profile, water-only &ldquo;Veterans Fast for Life&rdquo; against the Contra war being waged by his government in Nicaragua.

Brian Willson and the theme that runs throughout his compelling psycho-historical memoir. Willson&rsquo;s story begins in small-town, rural America, where he grew up as a &ldquo;Commie-hating, baseball-loving Baptist,&rdquo; moves through life-changing experiences in Viet Nam, Nicaragua and elsewhere, and culminates with his commitment to a localized, sustainable lifestyle. In telling his story, Willson provides numerous examples of the types of personal, risk-taking, nonviolent actions he and others have taken in attempts to educate and effect political change: tax refusal&mdash;which requires simplification of one&rsquo;s lifestyle; fasting&mdash;done publicly in strategic political and/or therapeutic spiritual contexts; and obstruction tactics&mdash;strategically placing one&rsquo;s body in the way of &ldquo;business as usual.&rdquo; It was such actions that thrust Brian Willson into the public eye in the mid-&rsquo;80s, first as a participant in a high-profile, water-only &ldquo;Veterans Fast for Life&rdquo; against the Contra war being waged by his government in Nicaragua. Then, on a fateful day in September 1987, the world watched in horror as Willson was run over by a U.S. government munitions train during a nonviolent blocking action in which he expected to be removed from the tracks and arrested.  Losing his legs only strengthened Willson&rsquo;s identity with millions of unnamed victims of U.S. policy around the world.

And those with enough time and energy to get angry and fight back are told that the answer is to vote for one of the two pro-war, pro&ndash;Wall Street corporate parties claiming to be their savior.\nThis epic tragedy does not sound like the beginning of a joke. But somehow comedian and TV host Lee Camp makes it both funny and interesting. Whether he is setting his sights on the scandal of $21 trillion worth of unaccounted-for financial adjustments at the Pentagon or the scorching environmental and human tragedy caused by climate chaos, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that one of our most incisive political commentators is technically a comedian. Camp knifes his way through the jungle of fake news, alternative facts, mainstream media lies, and government blackouts, trailblazing a path between Hunter S. Thompson and Jon Stewart.\nPerhaps the present-day story of America can only accurately be told by a comedian, otherwise no one would believe it. In a world where con men are heralded as leaders, locking up peace activists is perceived as justice, trumpeting state propaganda is considered journalism, and mocking environmentalists is championed as strength, it&rsquo;s only appropriate that a comedian is viewed as more reliable than the evening news."}{"isbnPrint":"9781629637860","isbn":"9781629638157","_id":"pmpressimport_burglar_for_peace","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"burglar_for_peace_9781629638157.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/burglar_for_peace_9781629638157.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/burglar_for_peace_.jpg"},"title":"Burglar for Peace: Lessons Learned in the Catholic Left's Resistance to the Vietnam War","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Burglar for Peace","slug":"burglar-for-peace","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"Lessons Learned in the Catholic Left's Resistance to the Vietnam War","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Ted Glick","Contributor 2 Role":"Foreword by","Contributor 2 Full Name":"Frida Berrigan","Contributor 3 Role":"","Contributor 3 Full Name":"","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"20.00","Main Description (HTML)":"<p><em>Burglar for Peace</em> is the incredible story of the Catholic Left&mdash;also known as the Ultra Resistance&mdash;from the late 1960s to the early &lsquo;70s.

In this way, Counterpoints is a collaborative, co-created atlas aimed at expanding knowledge on displacement and resistance in the Bay Area with, rather than for or about, those most impacted."}{"isbnPrint":"9781629631028","isbn":"9781629631387","_id":"pmpressimport_Crashing_the_Party","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"Crashing_the_Party_9781629631387.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/Crashing_the_Party_9781629631387.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/Crashing_the_Party_.jpg"},"title":"Crashing the Party: Legacies and Lessons from the RNC 2000","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Crashing the Party","slug":"crashing-the-party","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"Legacies and Lessons from the RNC 2000","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Kris Hermes","Contributor 2 Role":"Foreword by","Contributor 2 Full Name":"Marina Sitrin","Contributor 3 Role":"Afterword by","Contributor 3 Full Name":"Heidi Boghosian","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"22.95","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>Over the past fifteen years, people in the United States&mdash;and dissidents in particular&mdash;have witnessed a steady escalation of the National Security State, including invasive surveillance and infiltration, indiscriminate police violence, and unlawful arrests.

The results&mdash;wrecked lives, devastated communities, and an increasing reliance on credit to maintain our basic living standards&mdash;reveal an economic system that enriches the few at the expense of the many.\nThe Debt Resisters&rsquo; Operations Manual is a handbook for debtors everywhere to understand how this system really works, while providing practical tools for fighting debt in its most exploitative forms. Inside, you&rsquo;ll find detailed strategies, resources, and insider tips for dealing with some of the most common kinds of debt, including credit card debt, medical debt, student debt, and housing debt. The book also contains tactics for navigating the pitfalls of personal bankruptcy, and information to help protect yourself from credit reporting agencies, debt collectors, payday lenders, check cashing outlets, rent-to-own stores, and more.\nWritten and edited by a network of activists, writers, and academics from Occupy Wall Street, additional chapters cover tax debt, sovereign debt, the relationship between debt and climate, and an expanded vision for a movement of mass debt resistance."}

Our Outspoken Interview and a bibliography round out this long-awaited new collection."}{"isbnPrint":"9781629630427","isbn":"9781629633084","_id":"pmpressimport_First_Socialist_Schism","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"First_Socialist_Schism_9781629633084.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/First_Socialist_Schism_9781629633084.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/First_Socialist_Schism_.jpg"},"title":"First Socialist Schism: Bakunin vs. Marx in the International Working Men's Association","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"First Socialist Schism","slug":"first-socialist-schism","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"Bakunin vs. Marx in the International Working Men's Association","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Wolfgang Eckhardt","Contributor 2 Role":"","Contributor 2 Full Name":"","Contributor 3 Role":"","Contributor 3 Full Name":"","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"38.95","Main Description (HTML)":"<p><em>The First Socialist Schism</em> chronicles the conflicts in the International Working Men&rsquo;s Association (the First International, 1864&ndash;1877), which represents an important milestone in the history of political ideas and socialist theory.

Just a teenager when he entered the Louisiana penal system for the first time, King tells of his attempts to break out of this system, and his persistent pursuit of justice where there is none.\nYet this remains a story of inspiration and courage, and the triumph of the human spirit. The conditions in Angola almost defy description, yet King never gave up his humanity, or the work towards justice for all prisoners that he continues to do today. From the Bottom of the Heap, so simply and humbly told, strips bare the economic and social injustices inherent in our society, while continuing to be a powerful literary testimony to our own strength and capacity to overcome. The paperback edition includes additional writings from Robert King and an update on the case of the Angola 3."}{"isbnPrint":"9781629637891","isbn":"9781629638133","_id":"pmpressimport_fuck_neoliberalism","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"fuck_neoliberalism_9781629638133.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/fuck_neoliberalism_9781629638133.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/fuck_neoliberalism_.jpg"},"title":"Fuck Neoliberalism: Translating Resistance","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Fuck Neoliberalism","slug":"fuck-neoliberalism","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"Translating Resistance","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Simon Springer","Contributor 2 Role":"","Contributor 2 Full Name":"","Contributor 3 Role":"","Contributor 3 Full Name":"","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"18.00","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>In a long history of ruination and destruction, neoliberalism is the most recent and virulent form of capitalism.

It argues that&mdash;far from having ended&mdash;the crisis has ushered in a whole period of worldwide economic and political turbulence. In developing an account of the crisis as rooted in fundamental features of capitalism, <em>Global Slump</em> challenges the view that its source lies in financial deregulation.</p>\n<p>The book locates the recent meltdown in the intense economic restructuring that marked the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s.

It argues that&mdash;far from having ended&mdash;the crisis has ushered in a whole period of worldwide economic and political turbulence. In developing an account of the crisis as rooted in fundamental features of capitalism, Global Slump challenges the view that its source lies in financial deregulation.\nThe book locates the recent meltdown in the intense economic restructuring that marked the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s. Through this lens, it highlights the emergence of new patterns of world inequality and new centers of accumulation, particularly in East Asia, and the profound economic instabilities these produced. Global Slump offers an original account of the &ldquo;financialization&rdquo; of the world economy during this period, and explores the intricate connections between international financial markets and new forms of debt and dispossession, particularly in the Global South.\nAnalyzing the massive intervention of the world&rsquo;s central banks to stave off another Great Depression, Global Slump shows that, while averting a complete meltdown, this intervention also laid the basis for recurring crises for poor and working class people: job loss, increased poverty and inequality, and deep cuts to social programs.

An epistolary story about a story, &ldquo;The Nine Billion Names of God,&rdquo; uses a classic SF text to deconstruct literary deconstruction itself, with hilarious results. In the wickedly droll &ldquo;Bad Pennies,&rdquo; a spy tasked with trashing a foreign economy testifies before a complacent Congress. Quietly furious, &ldquo;The United States of Impunity&rdquo; is an alarming look under the tent of today&rsquo;s political sideshow. Adults only.  And Featuring: &ldquo;Gear. Food. Rocks.&rdquo;&mdash;our Outspoken Interview, in which a postmodern Renaissance man charts the synergies and dissonances of a career that embraces both literary and musical composition, reveals the hidden link between winemaking and deep space astronomy, and tells you how to steal his car."}{"isbnPrint":"9781629634487","isbn":"9781629634555","_id":"pmpressimport_Hafrocentric_Comics","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"Hafrocentric_Comics_9781629634555.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/Hafrocentric_Comics_9781629634555.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/Hafrocentric_Comics_.jpg"},"title":"Hafrocentric Comics: Volumes 1–4","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Hafrocentric Comics","slug":"hafrocentric-comics","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"Volumes 1–4","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Juliana \"Jewels\" Smith","Contributor 2 Role":"Illustrated by","Contributor 2 Full Name":"Ronald Nelson","Contributor 3 Role":"Colorist","Contributor 3 Full Name":"Mike Hampton","Contributor 4 Role":"Foreword by","Contributor 4 Full Name":"Kiese Laymon","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"20.00","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>Glyph Award winner Juliana &ldquo;Jewels&rdquo; Smith and illustrator Ronald Nelson have created an unflinching visual and literary tour-de-force on the most pressing issues of the day&mdash; including gentrification, police violence, and the housing crisis&mdash;with humor and biting satire. <em>(H)afrocentric</em> tackles racism, patriarchy, and popular culture head-on.

The text is accompanied by clean black-and-white illustrations that are mocking, beautiful, and bleak."}{"isbnPrint":"9781604860030","isbn":"9781604861402","_id":"pmpressimport_How_Shall_I_Live_My_Life","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"How_Shall_I_Live_My_Life_9781604861402.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/How_Shall_I_Live_My_Life_9781604861402.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/How_Shall_I_Live_My_Life_.jpg"},"title":"How Shall I Live My Life?: On Liberating the Earth from Civilization","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"How Shall I Live My Life?","slug":"how-shall-i-live-my-life","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"On Liberating the Earth from Civilization","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Derrick Jensen","Contributor 2 Role":"","Contributor 2 Full Name":"","Contributor 3 Role":"","Contributor 3 Full Name":"","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"20.00","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>In this collection of interviews, Derrick Jensen discusses the destructive dominant culture with ten people who have devoted their lives to undermining it.</p>\n<p>Whether it is Carolyn Raffensperger and her radical approach to public health, or Thomas Berry on perceiving the sacred; be it Kathleen Dean Moore reminding us that our bodies are made of mountains, rivers, and sunlight; or Vine Deloria asserting that our dreams tell us more about the world than science ever can, the activists and philosophers interviewed in <em>How Shall I Live My Life?</em> each bravely present a few of the endless forms that resistance can and must take. </p>\n<p>Interviews include: George Draffan, Jesse Wolf Hardin, Vine Deloria, David Abram, Steven Wise, Jan Lundber, David Edwards, Thomas Berry, Carolyn Raffensperger, and Kathleen Dean Moore.</p>","Description":"In this collection of interviews, Derrick Jensen discusses the destructive dominant culture with ten people who have devoted their lives to undermining it.\nWhether it is Carolyn Raffensperger and her radical approach to public health, or Thomas Berry on perceiving the sacred; be it Kathleen Dean Moore reminding us that our bodies are made of mountains, rivers, and sunlight; or Vine Deloria asserting that our dreams tell us more about the world than science ever can, the activists and philosophers interviewed in How Shall I Live My Life? each bravely present a few of the endless forms that resistance can and must take. \nInterviews include: George Draffan, Jesse Wolf Hardin, Vine Deloria, David Abram, Steven Wise, Jan Lundber, David Edwards, Thomas Berry, Carolyn Raffensperger, and Kathleen Dean Moore."}{"isbnPrint":"9781604865950","isbn":"9781604868807","_id":"pmpressimport_How_to_Make_Trouble_and_Influence_People","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"How_to_Make_Trouble_and_Influence_People_9781604868807.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/How_to_Make_Trouble_and_Influence_People_9781604868807.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/How_to_Make_Trouble_and_Influence_People_.jpg"},"title":"How to Make Trouble and Influence People: Pranks, Protests, Graffiti & Political Mischief-Making from across Australia","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"How to Make Trouble and Influence People","slug":"how-to-make-trouble-and-influence-people","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"Pranks, Protests, Graffiti & Political Mischief-Making from across Australia","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Iain McIntyre","Contributor 2 Role":"Foreword by","Contributor 2 Full Name":"Andrew Hansen","Contributor 3 Role":"Foreword by","Contributor 3 Full Name":"Josh MacPhee","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"24.95","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>This book reveals Australia&rsquo;s radical past through more than 500 tales of Indigenous resistance, convict revolts and escapes, picket line hijinks, student occupations, creative direct action, street art, media pranks, urban interventions, squatting, blockades, banner drops, guerilla theatre, and billboard liberation.

In this groundbreaking analysis of the meltdown, renowned radical political economists Albo, Gindin, and Panitch lay bare the roots of the crisis, which they locate in the dynamic expansion of capital on a global scale over the last quarter century&mdash;and in the inner logic of capitalism itself. </p>\n<p>With an unparalleled understanding of the inner workings of capitalism, the authors of <em>In and Out of Crisis</em> provocatively challenge the call by much of the Left for a return to a largely mythical Golden Age of economic regulation as a check on finance capital unbound.

In this groundbreaking analysis of the meltdown, renowned radical political economists Albo, Gindin, and Panitch lay bare the roots of the crisis, which they locate in the dynamic expansion of capital on a global scale over the last quarter century&mdash;and in the inner logic of capitalism itself. \nWith an unparalleled understanding of the inner workings of capitalism, the authors of In and Out of Crisis provocatively challenge the call by much of the Left for a return to a largely mythical Golden Age of economic regulation as a check on finance capital unbound.

Until the night they realize that they&rsquo;ve all survived rape&mdash;and that not one of their assailants has suffered a single consequence. Enough is enough.

With needles as their weapons, the revolution begins.\nA cop is stabbed through a doughnut hole and into his heart.

Le Guin&rsquo;s newest collection of poems, seeks meaning in an ever-connected world. In part evocative of Neruda&rsquo;s <em>Odes to Common Things</em> and Mary Oliver&rsquo;s poetic guides to the natural world, Le Guin gives voice to objects that may not speak a human language but communicate with us nevertheless through and about the seasonal rhythms of the earth, the minute and the vast, the ordinary and the mythological.</p>\n<p>As Le Guin herself states, &ldquo;science explicates, poetry implicates.&rdquo; Accordingly, this immersive, tender collection implicates us (in the best sense) in a subjectivity of everyday objects and occurrences.

Le Guin&rsquo;s newest collection of poems, seeks meaning in an ever-connected world. In part evocative of Neruda&rsquo;s Odes to Common Things and Mary Oliver&rsquo;s poetic guides to the natural world, Le Guin gives voice to objects that may not speak a human language but communicate with us nevertheless through and about the seasonal rhythms of the earth, the minute and the vast, the ordinary and the mythological.\nAs Le Guin herself states, &ldquo;science explicates, poetry implicates.&rdquo; Accordingly, this immersive, tender collection implicates us (in the best sense) in a subjectivity of everyday objects and occurrences. Deceptively simple in form, the poems stand as an invitation both to dive deep and to step outside of ourselves and our common narratives. As readers, we emerge refreshed, having peered underneath cultural constructs toward the necessarily mystical and elemental, no matter how late in the day.\nThe poems are bookended with two short essays, &ldquo;Deep in Admiration&rdquo; and &ldquo;Form, Free Verse, Free Form: Some Thoughts.&rdquo;\nIn 2014, the National Book Foundation awarded Le Guin the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, a lifetime achievement award. Her celebrated acceptance speech, which criticized Amazon as a &ldquo;profiteer&rdquo; and praised her fellow authors of fantasy and science fiction, is included in Late in the Day as a postscript."}

At the maximum-security Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, Ohio, prisoners seized a major area of the prison on Easter Sunday, 1993. More than 400 prisoners held L block for eleven days. Nine prisoners alleged to have been informants, or &ldquo;snitches,&rdquo; and one hostage correctional officer, were murdered. There was a negotiated surrender. Thereafter, almost wholly on the basis of testimony by prisoner informants who received deals in exchange, five spokespersons or leaders were tried and sentenced to death, and more than a dozen others received long sentences.</p>\n<p><em>Lucasville</em> examines the causes of the disturbance, what happened during the eleven days, and the fairness of the trials. Particular emphasis is placed on the interracial character of the action, as evidenced in the slogans that were found painted on walls after the surrender: &ldquo;Black and White Together,&rdquo; &ldquo;Convict Unity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Convict Race.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>An eloquent Foreword by Mumia Abu-Jamal underlines these themes.

As such, they did not betray each other; they did not dishonor each other; they reached beyond their prison &lsquo;tribes&rsquo; to reach commonality.&rdquo;</p>","Description":"Lucasville tells the story of one of the longest prison uprisings in U.S. history. At the maximum-security Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, Ohio, prisoners seized a major area of the prison on Easter Sunday, 1993. More than 400 prisoners held L block for eleven days. Nine prisoners alleged to have been informants, or &ldquo;snitches,&rdquo; and one hostage correctional officer, were murdered. There was a negotiated surrender. Thereafter, almost wholly on the basis of testimony by prisoner informants who received deals in exchange, five spokespersons or leaders were tried and sentenced to death, and more than a dozen others received long sentences.\nLucasville examines the causes of the disturbance, what happened during the eleven days, and the fairness of the trials. Particular emphasis is placed on the interracial character of the action, as evidenced in the slogans that were found painted on walls after the surrender: &ldquo;Black and White Together,&rdquo; &ldquo;Convict Unity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Convict Race.&rdquo; \nAn eloquent Foreword by Mumia Abu-Jamal underlines these themes. He states, as does the book, that the men later sentenced to death &ldquo;sought to minimize violence, and indeed, according to substantial evidence, saved the lives of several men, prisoner and guard alike.&rdquo; Of the five men, three black and two white, who were sentenced to death, Mumia declares, &ldquo;They rose above their status as prisoners, and became, for a few days in April 1993, what rebels in Attica had demanded a generation before them: men. As such, they did not betray each other; they did not dishonor each other; they reached beyond their prison &lsquo;tribes&rsquo; to reach commonality.&rdquo;"}{"isbnPrint":"9781604860856","isbn":"9781604862492","_id":"pmpressimport_Lucky_Strike","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"Lucky_Strike_9781604862492.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/Lucky_Strike_9781604862492.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/Lucky_Strike_.jpg"},"title":"Lucky Strike","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Lucky Strike","slug":"lucky-strike","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Kim Stanley Robinson","Contributor 2 Role":"","Contributor 2 Full Name":"","Contributor 3 Role":"","Contributor 3 Full Name":"","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"12.00","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>Combining dazzling speculation with a profoundly humanist vision, Kim Stanley Robinson is known as not only the most literary but also the most progressive (read &ldquo;radical&rdquo;) of today&rsquo;s top rank SF authors.

With hits like Bubba Ho-Tep and The Drive-In the Lansdale secret was always endangered, and the spectacular new Hap and Leonard Sundance TV series is busily blowing whatever cover Joe had left.\nBackwoods noir some call it; others call it redneck surrealism. Joe&rsquo;s signature style is on display here in all its grit, grime, and glory, beginning with two (maybe three) previously unpublished Hap and Leonard tales revealing the roots of their unlikely partnership.\nPlus&hellip;  A hatful and a half of Joe&rsquo;s notorious Texas Observer pieces that helped catapult him from obscurity into controversy; and &ldquo;Miracles Ain&rsquo;t What They Used to Be,&rdquo; Lansdale&rsquo;s passionately personal take on the eternal tussles between God and Man, Texas and America, racism and reason&mdash;and religion and common sense.\nAnd Featuring: Our Outspoken Interview, in which piney woods dialect, Bible thumpery, martial arts, crime classics and Hollywood protocols are finally awarded the attention they deserve.

Adrenaline-charged tales of train hopping, scams, and political agitation are combined with humorous and satirical songs, razor sharp reportage and unique insights into the lives of the women and men who crisscrossed America in search of survival and adventure.\nFrom iconic figures such as labor martyr Joe Hill and socialist novelist Jack London through to pioneering blues and country musicians, and little-known correspondents for the likes of the Hobo News, the authors and songwriters contained in On the Fly! run the full gamut of Hobohemia&rsquo;s wide cultural and geographical embrace. With little of the original memoirs, literature, and verse remaining in print, this collection, aided by a glossary of hobo vernacular and numerous illustrations and photos, provides a comprehensive and entertaining guide to the life and times of a uniquely American icon. Read on to enter a world where hoboes, tramps, radicals, and bums gather in jungles, flop houses, and boxcars; where gandy dancers, bindlestiffs, and timber beasts roam the rails once more."}

Her experience in the movement for Caribbean federation and independence is reflected in her introduction to Ujamaa, the socialism that Tanzanian villagers built, and in her work with Guyana, Haiti, and Venezuela.\n\nSteeped in the tradition of Marx urging the need for a &ldquo;practical movement,&rdquo; James recounts the unusual history of how autonomous organizations formed within the International Wages for Housework Campaign and reshaped it. Women of colour, queer women, sex workers, women with disabilities &hellip; each independent but mutually accountable (including to the men&rsquo;s network with whom they work) as they confront sexism, racism, deportation, rape, and other violence.\n\nJames makes the powerful argument that the struggle for climate justice can draw on all the movements people have formed to refuse exploitation and to end the capitalist hierarchy that is destroying the world.\n\nThere is one continuum between the care and protection of people and of the planet. The care income she campaigns for prioritizes both. Our time is now."}{"isbnPrint":"9781629632391","isbn":"9781629633190","_id":"pmpressimport_Out_of_the_Ruins","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"Out_of_the_Ruins_9781629633190.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/Out_of_the_Ruins_9781629633190.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/Out_of_the_Ruins_.jpg"},"title":"Out of the Ruins: The Emergence of Radical Informal Learning Spaces","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Out of the Ruins","slug":"out-of-the-ruins","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"The Emergence of Radical Informal Learning Spaces","Contributor 1 Role":"Edited by","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Robert H.

Liberals have objected to sport being used for political propaganda, and leftists have decried its role in distracting the masses from the class struggle. Yet, since the beginning of organized sports, athletes, fans, and officials have tried to administer and play it in ways that strengthen, rather than hinder, progressive social change. From the workers' sports movement in the early twentieth century to the civil rights struggle transforming sports in the 1960s to the current global network of grassroots sports clubs, there has been a growing desire to include sports in the struggle for liberation and social justice. It is a struggle that has produced larger-than-life figures like Muhammad Ali and iconic images such as the Black Power salute by Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. It is also a struggle that has seen sport fans in increasing number reclaiming the games they love from undemocratic associations, greedy owners, and corporate interests.</p>\n<p>With the help of over a hundred full-color illustrations&mdash;from posters and leaflets to paintings and photographs&mdash;<em>Playing as if the World Mattered</em> makes this history tangible.

Yet, since the beginning of organized sports, athletes, fans, and officials have tried to administer and play it in ways that strengthen, rather than hinder, progressive social change. From the workers' sports movement in the early twentieth century to the civil rights struggle transforming sports in the 1960s to the current global network of grassroots sports clubs, there has been a growing desire to include sports in the struggle for liberation and social justice. It is a struggle that has produced larger-than-life figures like Muhammad Ali and iconic images such as the Black Power salute by Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. It is also a struggle that has seen sport fans in increasing number reclaiming the games they love from undemocratic associations, greedy owners, and corporate interests.\nWith the help of over a hundred full-color illustrations&mdash;from posters and leaflets to paintings and photographs&mdash;Playing as if the World Mattered makes this history tangible. Extensive lists of resources, including publications, films, and websites, will allow the reader to explore areas of interest further.\nBeing the first illustrated history of its kind, Playing as if the World Mattered introduces an understanding of sports beyond chauvinistic jingoism, corporate media chat rooms, and multi-billion-dollar business deals."}{"isbnPrint":"9781629639437","isbn":"9781629639574","_id":"pmpressimport_Politics_at_a_Distance_from_the_State","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"Politics_at_a_Distance_from_the_State_9781629639574.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/Politics_at_a_Distance_from_the_State_9781629639574.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/Politics_at_a_Distance_from_the_State_.jpg"},"title":"Politics at a Distance from the State: Radical and African Perspectives","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Politics at a Distance from the State","slug":"politics-at-a-distance-from-the-state","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"Radical and African Perspectives","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Lucien van der Walt","Contributor 2 Role":"Author","Contributor 2 Full Name":"Kirk Helliker","Contributor 3 Role":"Preface by","Contributor 3 Full Name":"John Holloway","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"19.95","Main Description (HTML)":"<p><b>For decades, most anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements identified radical change with capturing state power.</b></p>\n<p> The collapse of statist projects from the 1970s fostered both neo-liberalism and a global crisis of left and working-class politics.

Our instinctive outrage at environmental collapse, political conspiracy, and corporate corruption is stifled by the double-speak of popular opinion telling us that the &ldquo;progress&rdquo; of civilization demands unquestioning allegiance to those in power. But the brave voices in <em>Truths Among Us</em> seek to help us acknowledge the values we know in our hearts are right&mdash;and inspire within us the courage to act on them.</p>\n<p>Among those who share their wisdom here is acclaimed sociologist Stanley Aronowitz, who shows us that science is but one lens through which we can discover knowledge.

Our instinctive outrage at environmental collapse, political conspiracy, and corporate corruption is stifled by the double-speak of popular opinion telling us that the &ldquo;progress&rdquo; of civilization demands unquestioning allegiance to those in power. But the brave voices in Truths Among Us seek to help us acknowledge the values we know in our hearts are right&mdash;and inspire within us the courage to act on them.\nAmong those who share their wisdom here is acclaimed sociologist Stanley Aronowitz, who shows us that science is but one lens through which we can discover knowledge. Luis Rodriguez, poet and peacemaker, asks us to embrace gang members as people instead of stereotypes, while the brilliant Judith Herman helps us gain a deeper understanding of the psychology of abusers in whatever form they may take. Paul Stamets reveals the power of fungi, whose intelligence, like that of so many nonhumans, is often ignored. And writer Richard Drinnon reminds us that our spiritual paths need not be narrowed by the limiting mythologies of Western civilization.\nFollowing How Shall I Live My Life? and Resistance Against Empire, Jensen's third collection of interviews reinforces a simple premise with which he has long challenged his readers: if we shut our ears and eyes to the cacophony of consumption-oriented distractions and pause to listen to the wisdom of our own hearts, the truths among us will reveal themselves.\nInterviewees include: George Gerbner, Stanley Aronowitz, Luis Rodriguez, Judith Herman, John Keeble, Richard Drinnon, Paul Stamets, Marc Ian Barasch, Mart&iacute;n Prechtel, and Jane Caputi."}{"isbnPrint":"9781604860702","isbn":"9781604864489","_id":"pmpressimport_Tunnel_People","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"Tunnel_People_9781604864489.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/Tunnel_People_9781604864489.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/Tunnel_People_.jpg"},"title":"Tunnel People","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Tunnel People","slug":"tunnel-people","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Tuen Voeten","Contributor 2 Role":"","Contributor 2 Full Name":"","Contributor 3 Role":"","Contributor 3 Full Name":"","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"24.95","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>At the end of the millennium, thousands of homeless people roamed the streets of Manhattan.

They have mobilized on a wide range of issues: fighting against mines and agribusiness and for living space, rural and urban; for social space won through recognition of language, culture, and equal participation; for community and environmental survival. The book is organized in chapters by country with each chapter introduced by a solidarity activist, writer, or academic with deep knowledge of the place.

They have deployed a wide range of strategies and actions, sometimes building schools or clinics, sometimes occupying factories or fields, sometimes building and occupying political parties to take the reins of the state, and sometimes resisting government policies in order to protect their newfound power in community.\nThis unique collection of interviews features five dozen leaders and grassroots activists from fifteen countries presenting their work and debating pressing questions of power, organizational forms, and relations with the state. They have mobilized on a wide range of issues: fighting against mines and agribusiness and for living space, rural and urban; for social space won through recognition of language, culture, and equal participation; for community and environmental survival. The book is organized in chapters by country with each chapter introduced by a solidarity activist, writer, or academic with deep knowledge of the place. This indispensable compilation of primary source material gives participants, students, and observers of social movements a chance to learn from their experience.\nContributors include ACOGUATE, Luis Ballesteros, Marc Becker, Margi Clarke, Benjamin Dangl, Mar Daza, Mickey Ellinger, Michael Fox, J.

To her surprise and annoyance, she finds another person in the house, a fugitive, Joel, ten years younger than she, a kid who dropped into the underground out of the army. As they spend the next days together, Vida finds herself warming toward a man for the first time in years, knowing the dangers all too well.\nAs counterpoint to the underground &rsquo;70s, Marge Piercy tells the extraordinary tale of the optimistic &rsquo;60s, the thousands of people who were members of SAW (Students Against the War) and of the handful who formed a fierce group called the Little Red Wagon. Piercy&rsquo;s characters make vivid and comprehensible the desperation, the courage, and the blind rage of a time when &ldquo;action&rdquo; could appear to some to be a more rational choice than the vote. \nA new introduction by Marge Piercy situates the book, and the author, in the times from which they emerged."}{"isbnPrint":"9781629631004","isbn":"9781629631820","_id":"pmpressimport_Voices_of_the_Paris_Commune","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"Voices_of_the_Paris_Commune_9781629631820.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/Voices_of_the_Paris_Commune_9781629631820.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/Voices_of_the_Paris_Commune_.jpg"},"title":"Voices of the Paris Commune","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Voices of the Paris Commune","slug":"voices-of-the-paris-commune","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"","Contributor 1 Role":"Edited and translated by","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Mitchell Abidor","Contributor 2 Role":"","Contributor 2 Full Name":"","Contributor 3 Role":"","Contributor 3 Full Name":"","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"14.95","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>The Paris Commune of 1871, the first instance of a working-class seizure of power, has been subject to countless interpretations; reviled by its enemies as a murderous bacchanalia of the unwashed while praised by supporters as an exemplar of proletarian anarchism in action.

It&rsquo;s a readjustment of bite, humor, and perspective as Brown channels hip-hop, Toni Morrison, and Snagglepuss to make way for the shudder and eruption of wisdom."}{"isbnPrint":"9781629635682","isbn":"9781629635842","_id":"pmpressimport_witches_witchhunting_and_women","_type":"book","JSONREMOVE_filename":"witches_witchhunting_and_women_9781629635842.pdf","file":{"_type":"file","_sanityAsset":"file@file://~/brietimport/witches_witchhunting_and_women_9781629635842.pdf"},"cover":{"_type":"image","_sanityAsset":"image@file://~/brietimport/witches_witchhunting_and_women_.jpg"},"title":"Witches, Witch-Hunting, and Women","JSONREMOVE_Supertitle":"Witches, Witch-Hunting, and Women","slug":"witches-witchhunting-and-women","JSONREMOVE_Subtitle":"","Contributor 1 Role":"Author","Contributor 1 Full Name":"Silvia Federici","Contributor 2 Role":"","Contributor 2 Full Name":"","Contributor 3 Role":"","Contributor 3 Full Name":"","Contributor 4 Role":"","Contributor 4 Full Name":"","Contributor 5 Role":"","Contributor 5 Full Name":"","Contributor 6 Role":"","Contributor 6 Full Name":"","Contributor 7 Role":"","Contributor 7 Full Name":"","Price":"14.00","Main Description (HTML)":"<p>We are witnessing a new surge of interpersonal and institutional violence against women, including new witch hunts.

World War 3 Illustrated also illuminates the war we wage on each other&mdash;and sometimes the one taking place in our own minds. World War 3 artists have been covering the topics that matter for over 30 years, and they&rsquo;re just getting warmed up.\nContributors include Sue Coe, Eric Drooker, Fly, Sandy Jimenez, Sabrina Jones, Peter Kuper, Mac McGill, Kevin Pyle, Spain Rodriguez, Nicole Schulman, Seth Tobocman, Susan Willmarth, and dozens more."}
